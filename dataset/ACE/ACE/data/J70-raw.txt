SUMMARY   The antenna configurations used for both earth stations and
satellites are considered in some detail following an introduction outlining
relevant basic antenna principles. The specifications applicable to antennas
used for satellite communications and their effects on the design of the
antennas are considered. Examples of both earth-station and satellite antennas
and their characteristics are illustrated by reference to the INTELSAT and
AUSSAT networks. Future trends in earth-station and satellite antenna design
are also considered.


	<h>1   INTRODUCTION </h>
	

Antenna systems used in satellite communications are the vital link in the
transfer of information between the ground station and the satellite and
also between satellites. The increasing sophistication of each successive
generation of satellites has meant that their antenna requirements have
become more demanding. Further, with the reduction in the angular spacing
between satellites in the geostationary orbit, tighter specifications are
being placed on the earth-station antenna performance. In this paper we
consider current and projected antenna systems developed to meet these
demands, with emphasis on the Australian context. This will be illustrated
by referring to the INTELSAT network within Australia (Figure 1) and also
the AUSSAT domestic satellite communication system (Figure 2).

Antenna design requirements for ground stations differ from those for
satellites. In both cases however some type of feed-reflector configuration
is commmonly used. We begin therefore with a general description of
feed-reflector antenna principles. This is followed by separate sections
dealing with earth-station and satellite antennas in turn.


	<h>2   REFLECTOR ANTENNA FUNDAMENTALS </h>
	

The basic operation of a reflector antenna is to concentrate into a desired
region signals emanating from a feed antenna. Figure 3 shows in cross-section
various feed-reflector configurations found in satellite communication
antennas. For earth stations, and for some satellite applications, these
configurations are designed to maximize the signal in one direction - i.e.
for the examples given in Figure 3, parallel to the ray paths leaving the
aperture. Since a great deal of the terminology derives from such focused
or &quot;pencil-beam&quot; antennas, we begin by describing their main characteristics.


	<note> Figure 3 </note>
	

It is not possible to design an antenna which confines all of the energy
within a narrow beam (pencil beam). A number of effects contribute to
unavoidable radiation into unwanted directions to produce sidelobes. The
spatial distribution of these sidelobes, together with the main beam, taken
over a spherical surface surrounding the reflector is known as the antenna
radiation pattern. Figure 4 illustrates the basic principles.
  
The electric field radiated by an antenna is a vector quantity and can be
resolved into two orthogonal (i.e. independent) components. This field
polarization can be either linear, where the two independent signals are
vertically and horizontally polarized as depicted in Figure 4, or circular,
where the independent signals rotate in a left-hand and right-hand sense
of polarization. By radiating different signals in the two polarizations
the capacity of the antenna may be doubled: this is one form of &quot;frequency
re-use&quot;. The spatial distribution of the desired signal is the &quot;co-polar&quot;
radiation pattern, seen in Figure 4b, while the &quot;cross-polar&quot; pattern (Figure
4c) gives the energy in the unwanted polarization. A low level of
cross-polarization around the direction of the main beam (boresight) is
essential to reduce unwanted interference to the other polarization when
frequency re-use is required.
  
For a pencil-beam reflector antenna most of the energy is concentrated within
the co-polar main beam - typically 90% - while the remainder is expended
in the surrounding sidelobes and the cross-polar component. The width of
the main beam is usually specified by the angle between the half-power points.
As the diameter of the main reflector increases the beamwidth decreases,
with a subsequently enhanced field intensity within the beam. This is expressed
as antenna gain G, which is the ratio of the power density radiated in the
direction of the main beam to the power density due to an antenna radiating
the same input power uniformly in all direction. If D is the main reflector
diameter and 
	<note>λ</note>
	 is the signal wavelength, then 
	<note>?</note>
	. The factor

	<note>η</note>
	 is the aperture efficiency and related to the field distribution across
the main reflector aperture. For maximum gain this distribution should
be uniform. 

In the case of the satellite antenna it may be desirable to design it for
approximately constant gain across a chosen extended angular region. This
is often achieved by &quot;shaping&quot; the main reflector profile or using an array
of horns as the feed. In the latter each horn may be considered to radiate
a pencil beam to form a composite beam that is the superposition of the
multiple beams. For example, Figure 5 shows the formation of an almost uniform
beam from several pencil beams. By adjusting the amplitude and phase
relationship between pencil beams new, quite complicated, beam shapes can
be devised (see Section 4).

The unwanted random signals that an antenna receives from the sky and the
earth degrade the overall performance. This noise contribution is expressed
as an equivalent antenna noise temperature 
	<note>?</note>
	 (in kelvins). The ratio of
gain to overall temperature,

	<note> Figures 4 and 5 </note>
	
denoted by G/T (expressed as dB 
	<note>?),</note>
	 is a commonly used figure of merit
for receiving antennas. Here 
	<note>?,</note>
	 where 
	<note>?</note>
	 is the temperature
contribution due to feed losses and receiver noise. In earth-station antenna
design in particular it is essential to maximize G/T, and for this reason
the dual-reflector Cassegrain-type configuration of Figure 3b is preferred
to the simple front-fed paraboloid reflector shown in Figure 3a. The
additional reflector gives an extra degree of freedom in the design: the
two reflector profiles can be defined to enhance the gain by providing almost
uniform aperture illumination, while at the same time keeping the temperature
T low by minimizing &quot;spillover&quot; effects at the edges of the reflectors.
Spillover is especially important past the main reflector edge, since this
allows energy to be received directly from the &quot;hot&quot; earth.

A disadvantage of any axisymmetric reflector antenna is the blockage created
by the feed or subreflector and associated strut supports. These obstructions
have a deleterious effect on the antenna gain and, more important, on sidelobe
levels, particularly for small antennas 
	<note>(?)</note>
	. Blockage can be avoided
by using the offset-fed reflector configurations of Figures 3c and 3d.
Although the lack of symmetry creates a number of design problems these
antennas are capable of performance which is superior to that of their
axisymmetrical counterparts. They are at present expensive to build, and
the largest constructed to date has an aperture diameter of around 12 m.
However, because of the better performance offered by offset antennas,
they are used extensively for on-board satellite antennas.

More detailed information on the design of reflector antennas can be obtained
in references 1 and 2. 


	<h>3    EARTH-STATION ANTENNAS </h>
	

Antennas for earth stations encompass a wide range of sizes depending on
the type of service. In Australia the largest size is the 32-m-diameter
axisymmetrical antennas operated by OTC for international communications
via INTELSAT satellites. However, there is now a trend towards greater use
of 18-m-diameter antennas, and these are gradually being installed in some
capital cities. The major bands used by INTELSAT are the 6/4 GHz bands,
where the 6 GHz band is for the uplink (transmitting) and 4 GHz for the
downlink (receiving). The bandwidth in each direction is 580 MHz, and both
senses of circular polarization are used to double the communication capacity.
One of the smallest earth-station antennas is the 1.2-m front-fed paraboloids
for the HACBSS (homestead) receive-only service used with the
dual-linearly-polarized AUSSAT satellite system operating in the 14/12
GHz bands. For transmission the minimum size is about 2 m. Where transmission
is involved a number of specifications have to be met. These usually include:

(1) The G/T on receive, and on transmit the effective isotropic radiated
    power level (EIRP) in the direction of the satellite. The values specified
    depend on the type of service.

(2) The isolation in decibels (dB) between orthogonal polarizations. For
    a dual-polarized system a value of approximately 30 dB is usually specified
    for angles within 1 dB of the main beam.

(3) The peak level of the radiation pattern sidelobes for all angles greater
    than 1 from boresight. This is specified as a function 
	<note>?</note>
	 given in
    decibels relative to an isotropic source (dBi). Most telecommunications
    administrations use the CCIR recommendations, which are

      
	<note> Formulas </note>
	

The latter recommendation recognizes the fact that it is more difficult to
achieve low sidelobe levels with small antennas.

With the widespread use of axisymmetric dual-reflector Cassegrain antennas,
particularly for earth-station antennas having diameters 18 m or less, it
is of interest to consider some of the design concepts and performance
characteristics of this type of antenna. Figure 6 (foreground) shows a typical
Cassegrain antenna (Moree 1), where the feed-horn, polarizer-diplexer unit
(feed-system), and low-noise receiver (LNA) are situated in the cone housing
at the vertex.


	<note> Figure 6 </note>
	

Some new design concepts were initiated and applied during a recent upgrading
of the Moree 1 Cassegrain antenna carried out by CSIRO Division of Radiophysics
in collaboration with OTC. This upgrading was necessary to ensure that the
revised INTELSAT specifications on earth-station antennas could be met
to permit access to the new INTELSAT V satellites. A feature developed to
meet the specifications was a corrugated horn with specially shaped
&quot;ring-loaded&quot; slots - see Figure 7. The use of ring-loaded slots and the 
design of the geometry of the horn in the throat region are critical factors 
in achieving a good match, constant beamwidth and low cross-polarization over 
an octave bandwidth or greater. The aperture section of the replacement horn 
for Moree 1 is shown in Figure 8. In optimizing the optics of the antenna the 
usual uniform illumination was replaced by that shown in Figure 9. The taper 
of 15 dB reduces spillover of energy past the edge of the main reflector and 
of energy scattered by diffraction at the reflector rim. Furthermore, the 
reduction of energy in the central blocked region also minimizes the energy 
scattered by the secondary reflector. With this as the basis for the aperture 
illumination, and by specifying tight tolerances on the machining of the new 
subreflector and setting of the surface panels, it was possible to achieve the 
low sidelobes for the antenna shown

	<note> Figures 7, 8 and 9 </note>
	
in Figure 10. The mean level is 8 dB below the specification set for new
antennas. (The details of the upgrading and performance of the Moree 1 antenna
are given in reference 3.)

	<h> Future developments </h>
	

Looking to the future, we see that the major effects on earth-station antenna
design will arise from the use of increased bandwidth, the use of a number
of pairs of frequency bands, and the need to reduce the interference to
neighbouring satellites as the spacing is reduced to accommodate more of
them. Already the CCIR recommendation for antennas installed after 1987 is
for a 3-dB-tighter sidelobe specification where 
	<note>?</note>
	. 
	<note>?</note>
	. Although the
future recommendation for smaller antennas 
	<note>(?)</note>
	 is still under
discussion there is a possibility that the same criterion could eventually
become mandatory for all reflector diameters. This could well force the
use of offset reflectors for all small to medium-size earth-station antennas.
As a consequence of the increased number of satellites in the geostationary
orbit there is now a demand for communication between one earth station
and two or more neighbouring satellites. This, coupled with the wider bandwidth
requirements, will have considerable effect on feed and reflector design.


	<h>4    ON-BOARD SATELLITE ANTENNAS </h>
	

Antennas on board a satellite operate in a very different environment and
have objectives which sometimes differ significantly from those of
earth-station antennas. The communication antennas produce one or more beams,
each beam defining a coverage region, or &quot;footprint&quot; on the earth's surface.
Signals are either transmitted to or received from these footprints. The
type of beams generated may be a single pencil, or spot, beam over a major
city (e.g. Sydney or Melbourne), or a contoured beam designed to follow
the boundary of a State or country, as illustrated in Figure 2. An extreme
case of this is a circular beam of angular width 17.4° giving full earth
coverage from the geostationary orbit.

Apart from making the best use of the available satellite transmitter power, a contoured-beam antenna reduces interference to adjacent coverage regions and makes possible a more uniform coverage in the desired region.
