	<misc> JOHN BAXTER profiles the unpredictable British film and opera director who
is visiting Australia to direct Madame Butterfly at Melbourne's Spoleto
Festival </misc>
	

WHEN Ken Russell was a young director for the BBC TV series Monitor in
the 60s, producer Huw Weldon sent him to make a film on Old Battersea House,
a private museum of PreRaphaelite art in suburban London maintained by a
Mrs Stirling, the sister of painter Evelyn de Morgan. &quot;She was 99 then,&quot;
Russell reminisced, &quot;dripping with white furs and jewels, and wearing an
enormous hat. She could walk only with the help of two sticks and the place
was so dark a servant followed her around with a lamp, and illuminated the
pictures. Mrs Stirling had a guided tour all memorised. `My sister was
at work on this painting of Azrael the Angel of Death when a frog hopped
in and looked at it and hopped out again. £400 worth of lapis lazuli on
that picture ...' and we went on through these huge rooms. People are always
saying my films are bizarre but they pale beside reality.&quot;
  People are always saying Ken Russell is bizarre, but he too pales beside
reality. The experience of spending a year in his almost continuous company
while writing a book about him was an experience the years have not dimmed,
and his arrival to direct Puccini's Madame Butterfly for Melbourne's Spoleto
Festival of Three Worlds brings it back in a rush.
  Russell in 1972 had never directed an opera, though in the course of that
year he would open negotiations with Peter Maxwell Davies to stage his
Taverner at Covent Garden, with the young Derek Jarman designing.
  It could have been a land-mark. I still have the sketchbook Jarman gave
me, with its epicene costumes of men/women, and apes dressed as cardinals.
And Russell had announced - with what seriousness it's hard to say - that
his plans included flayed bullocks on the walls and nuns and monks fornicating
in the aisles.
