ESTABLISHMENTS just sit up there waiting to be shot at most of the time,
adopting stiff-necked attitudes and getting all pompous over the most trivial
things.
  Police Academy, on Channel 9 tomorrow night at 8.30, shows them up.
  Its tacky plot doesn't matter. It's funny, it's good and it's a parody,
if a little blunt.
  The story revolves around mayor Mary Sue Beal's decision to abandon all
restrictions involving police applicants.
  There are no longer stringent restrictions on height, weight, age, race,
sex, education or mental stability.
  Everyone is invited. The tall and short accept, the fat and thin are welcome,
and the timid and paranoid make friends.
  There's a disgraced parking attendant, a society girl, and the gun-happy
Tackleberry.
  There's a florist who wants a more exciting life, and a jailbird who can
imitate mechanical noises. 
  The policy elicits contempt and disgust from the established force when
the floodgates open, and they are inundated with criminals and prostitutes,
comedians and mummy's boys, peepers and psychotics.
  The conglomerate farce goes on to detail the training procedure at the
Metropolitan Police Academy. Their exploits at the centre are barely
printable. It is definitely not a law and order film.
  Instead it's packed with frantic energy, a dash of sex, is rudely
contemptuous of authority and has all the ingredients of good fun.
  But there's a strangely ironic twist.
  The thugs get in and and good guys don't. The nice blokes don't want to
become policemen, and the bad guys do.
  The weirdos come in to become weirder. The horrible become more horrible.
The most unlikely to succeed, succeed. The pseudo-good guys dismantle law
and order.
  When a riot breaks out in the town, creating a life-threatening situation,
the cadets are given an unexpected opportunity to test their mettle, and
the results are ironic.
  The supposedly-bad guys save the day.
  The irony continues and the academy's fundamentals to serve and to protect,
to cultivate integrity, increase knowledge, and show courage are mocked.
  The highest award of the police force is eventually granted to the artful
dodger, Mahoney (Steve Guttenberg), and Moses Hightower, a gentle giant,
both of whom were originally thrown out of the establishment for incompetence.
  Police Academy is frantic and garbled, but effective. It becomes a riotous
epic of counter-culture and its large cast never proves unwieldy.
 The result is a shrewd blend of slapstick and comedy as unpredictable
as it is disrespectful ... comedy that has made the cash registers ring
with gleeful profits at the movie theatres.
