	<h> Mall to celebrate its 10th birthday </h>
	

WHEN Rundle Mall was officially opened almost a decade ago it was described as
one of the &quot;most dramatic developments&quot; our city has seen.
  It was a $1.2 million development which saw Adelaide's busiest shopping
area transformed from a traffic jammed pedestrian nightmare into a shoppers'
paradise.
  As the then Premier, Mr Dunstan, declared the mall open on September 1,
1976 champagne flowed from the famous Gawler Pl fountain, hundreds of balloons
were released and &quot;Mall maids&quot; gave away daffodils and shopping bags.
  Today Rundle Mall is one of the State's top tourist attractions and an
exciting shopping precinct boasting 11 arcades, four major shopping stores
and more than 800 retailers.
  Next month a host of festivities in the mall will celebrate its 10th
birthday.
