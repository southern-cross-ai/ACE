IT was not a good week in many ways for the National Party. There were more
claims of party cronyism, one allegedly involving a Cabinet minister. There
was also Sir Joh's cousin, Les.
  And towards the end of the week, the Premier's political opponents must
have had a good laugh on first hearing of his plan for a space station on
Cape York. But Sir Joh has long had a reputation for landing on his feet,
and an apparently far-fetched idea appears to have been basically sound.
  One expert says Australia would have an advantage over other nations,
because a satellite-launching base close to the equator would mean larger
payloads. Another described Sir Joh's $93,000 feasibility study as a &quot;serious&quot;
project.
  But what must have pleased the Premier most is that he beat the Federal
Government to the gun. The day after his announcement came the news that
Canberra was to establish a National Space Board to co-ordinate space
technology activities by Australian companies.
