TICK UP a new charge against the Aussie Taxman. 
  Long reputed to be greedy, he is now revealed as having been a bumbling
incompetent.
  Over a decade, says a parliamentary committee, the tax office failed
to spend  $39 million it was given to improve its computer equipment.
  As a result, it lost $2 billion a year because it could not process all
the information available to it. 
  No doubt many people are laughing their heads off because some of that
$2 billion a year is still in their pocket or stashed away in a Swiss bank.
  But put your last cent on this red hot certainty: the average worker with
a weekly pay packet has being paying more to make up for the deficiencies
of the Tax Office.
  That has happened with grim and automatic efficiency as marginal rates
of income tax put ordinary workers into tax brackets intended years ago
to embrace the rich.
  Now, PAYE workers have to live with the knowledge that they not only
subsidised the tax evasion games of the wealthy but also a Tax Office which
leaked like a sieve.
  Efficiency has been the motive, if not always the method, of Mr Keating's
tax reforms.
  That is why the Tax Office pressed for a national ID card to cut into
the cash economy and prevent social security fraud.
  Efficiency may well have to start at home - before the Tax Office is given
new powers.
  The Tax Office claims to be catching up with new computer systems.
  But the parliamentary watchdog will be justified in treating that tax
claim with suspicion and calling for proof.
