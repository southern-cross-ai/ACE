  SUPERSOAP series &quot;Return to Eden&quot; may be scrubbed ... and that will have
fans bristling!
  Channel O's Monday night drama bows out next week with an inconclusive
ending, amid rumors that there will not be a second series. And the finale
leaves the major storyline right up in the air.
  The ending has been tailor-made for a continuing series, but indifferent
ratings have put its future in doubt.
  Nevertheless, be prepared for a cliff-hanger on Monday. It's not a case
of Who Shot JR? but one of Who Can Prove Who Really Shot Who?
There's a fatality - or what looks like a fatality - among the major cast
list. Will it be Jilly? Stephanie? Perhaps Jake?
  Suffice to say that the evil Jilly is up to her scheming tricks and
is nasty to the end. And Jake isn't much better.
  There's a gala party in the final scenes climaxed by the dramatic shooting
with a body tumbling down the stairs. Then the dramatic appearance of the
other players in this shooting scene.
  And there's even a Melbourne Cup scene in Monday's episode. Will Jilly
and Jake's steed down Stephanie's entrant and bag the booty? Will anyone
really want another series? I won't.
