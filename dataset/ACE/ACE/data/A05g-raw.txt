	<h> WALL ST TRADING AT ONE-MONTH LOW </h>
	

WALL Street suffered its slowest trading day in a month on Friday, although 
the index managed to end the session in the plus column.
  By the close of trade the Dow Jones industrial average, which fell 34.73 
points on Thursday, was up 1.13 points at 1769.69.
  Big Board volume amounted to 115.27 million shares compared with 134.29 
million on Thursday.
  It is the lowest level since August 25 when 104.35 million shares changed 
hands.  Traders said the stockmarket suffered from early weakness in the 
bond market but was able to bounce back.  Takeover activity continues to 
draw much of the spotlight, they said.
  Janney Montogomery Scott, vice-president in equity trading of Sidney Dorr 
said trading was &quot;fairly sloppy&quot; as money managers &quot;window dressed&quot; their 
portfolios before the end of the third quarter.
  Oppenheimer and Co market analyst Charles Comer said the market remained 
trendless and polarised.
  Standard and Poor's 500-stock index edged up 0.02 points to 232.23; the New 
York Stock Exchange composite index rose 0.45 points to 133.94.
  Prices ended narrowly higher in moderate trading on the American Stock 
Exchange.  The index rose 2.86 points to 261.98.
London
  SHARE prices closed on the bottom on Friday with sentiment at its lowest 
ebb.
