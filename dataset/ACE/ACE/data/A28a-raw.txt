 The couple who allegedly neglected their young sons over a two-year
period have been given protection in jail.
  Authorities fear Donald Richard Capetti, 39, and his wife, Robyn Francis
Cappetti, 41, will be attacked by other prisoners outraged at the allegations
of abuse against their sons, 4 and 2.
  The Cappettis are each charged with three counts of inflicting grievous
bodily harm on two of their five children.
  Police discovered the children when they investigated a fire at the Cappettis'
home in Werrington, on Saturday night. 
  Darren, 4, weighed only 11kg when he was found tied to a door by a length
of rope.
  His brother, David, 2, was found in a filthy state, weighing only 12kg.
  Police alleged Darren had cockroach infestations in his nappy and his
stomach had been scalded by urine.
  He had been tied to a door and had slept on a urine-soaked foam mattress
for two years.
  His right foot had become gangrenous.
  David had allegedly suffered scalding from wearing wet nappies for too
long.
  Penrith Court was told the two children had not been washed for two months
and their fingers and toes had stuck together with grime.
  Police alleged they were not fed at times for up to five days.
  A spokesman for the Corrective Services Minister, Mr Akister, said the
Cappittis had been given protective custody for their own safety.
  Mr Cappetti has been held at Parklea maximum security prison while Mrs
Cappetti is being detained at Silverwater Prison.
  &quot;It is normal procedure to offer prisoners associated with child-related
crimes protective custody,&quot; the spokesman said.
  &quot;In some cases we give them protective custody straight away.  The Cappettis
willingly accepted it.
