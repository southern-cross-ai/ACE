	<h> Soothing statistics don't solve 1987 economic prospects </h>

DESPITE last month's lower trade deficit and the OECD's forecast of strong
GDP growth in 1987, doubts are emerging in the market place about the prospects
for next year's economy.
  Soothing words from the Australian Bureau of Statistics confirming the
accuracy of the November current account deficit of $685 million have been
taken to heart by a financial market searching desperately for any good
news.  Combined with the OECD's forecast of a surprisingly strong 3.25
per cent GDP growth rate, this continued to support the Australian dollar
on Friday.
  But the feeling among some economists and foreign exchange dealers this
weekend is that the November deficit figure will still be revised upwards.
Estimates of the strength of any possible upward revision vary considerably,
but Melbourne economist Patrick O'Leary, of McCaughan Dyson and Co, says,
&quot;There is no way the figures can be right.  Not even when Afghanistan was
invaded did its imports fall by a fifth.&quot;         
  Expectations for the January and February balance of trade figures are
also not optimistic, with the market already forecasting a resumption of
$1 billion plus monthly deficits next year.
  The Government is believed to be hoping to contain the current account
deficit to $6 billion in the first six months of calendar 1987.  While market
watchers say this is possible, some remain sceptical.
  This weekend, market experts are tipping real growth of between 1.5 and
2.5 per cent over the coming year.  This is well short of the OECD 3.25
per cent, which also conflicts with the outcome which is hoped for and expected
by Federal Treasury.
  Traditionally, OECD forecasts on the Australian economy have mirrored
fairly closely the views of Treasury as the Government of the day has been
able to persuade the OECD to endorse the Treasury line.
  But the Government's ambition to rein in the current account deficit would
probably receive a body blow if the Paris-based organisation's forecast
of 3.25 per cent growth was realised.
  On the outlook for growth in 1987, Patrick O'Leary is not optimistic,
&quot;The contribution to GDP from investment went negative in the full year
to September,&quot; he said.
  &quot;The Keating assumption is that growth will come from net trade, but if
the $A continues to go up we are not going to get a positive contribution
to GDP from net trade.  So where is the growth going to come from?
  &quot;It is not going to come from private sector activity - the average
household is in hock up to its eyebrows,&quot; he said.
  Many market watchers question whether the Reserve Bank will be able to
retain the control it has exercised during the past few months over the
$US/$A exchange rate.
  The Reserve Bank has been an active player in the market in an attempt
to reduce the volatility of the exchange rate, and Ray Block, economist
with brokers Dominguez Barry Samuel Montagu, says that provided pressure
from our booming sharemarket eases a little in the new year, the Bank will
be able to reassert its control.
  &quot;The perseverance of the bank is very important to us - the degree of
volatility in our currency should not be perceived to be greater than other
currencies,&quot; he said.
  According to Kevin Tuckey, corporate adviser with Macquarie Bank &quot;the
Reserve Bank is not trying to put a lid on the $A, it is just trying to
slow its growth&quot; in a climate of strong overseas support for our currency.
