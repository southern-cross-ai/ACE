	<h> Girl, 15, beats rape bid </h>
	

A TEENAGE girl was saved by an elderly man when three men tried to rape
her in Geelong on Saturday night.
  Police said three men in a car began making suggestive comments to the
girl as walked along Hitchcock Av about 11.45 pm.
  The girl, 15, from Barwon Heads, became frightened when the men chased
her into the grounds of a church.
  Police said that after the men caught up with her she was assaulted until
an elderly man came to her aid.  The attackers ran off.
  Police said they had no descriptions of the men but they were believed
to be driving a small, white station wagon. 
  In another incident, a 18-year-old woman was forced into a car as she
stood outside the Croydon Hotel, Maroondah Highway, about 2.15 am yesterday.
