  Well, at least we'll have the telly to keep us warm.
  It might be all we have soon, what with rising costs of electricity,
gas and oil - and now a Big Brotherly interest in the returning popularity
of wood fires.
  I'm told that, in the US, one can buy videos of cosy fires. You pop the
cassette in and, presumably, stretch your chilblained tootsies towards
the TV and hold out your palms to absorb the imagined warmth.
  Nothing much wrong with that, I suppose. Wood fires are notoriously
inefficient and much of their warmth comes from the imagination, anyway. A
lovely log fire is as much in a man's heart as in his hearth.
  It's always been so. A fire is as atavistic as suckling and its discovery
as fundamental in the gentling of the human beast as the invention of the
wheel.
  Who still does not enjoy the primitive mysticism of huddling over a camp
fire while the billy boils - a friendly cauldron brewing spells to ward
off the black sorcery of the night while stardusting us with the eternity
of the heavens above?
  Even in the urban blandness of our cream-brick castles we can gaze into
our little manicured fires and pretend we are strutting squires or lonely
adventurers or Joan of Arc at the stake. God, what would Scott of the
Antarctic have given for one blazing log to die by?
  Those flames are the stuff that dreams are made of. And as they die we
can snooze off, snug in a momentary immortality.
  But such are the petty temporal concerns of our fusspot neighbors, not
everyone sees it that way.

Hard to sleep

  According to a report in The Advertiser yesterday, the SA Department of
Environment and Planning has received about 80 complaints a year recently
about soot from wood fires falling on neighbors' washing, smoke enveloping
their houses and smells making it hard to sleep.
  Smells! Hell, wood smoke must be the most romantic fragrance outside a
boudoir.
  Still one sympathises. And only a cad would let his ash fall on a neighbor's
washing or burn wet wood or chemically treated timber which gives off toxic
fumes.
  The department has issued guides on how to use wood heaters correctly
and efficiently. It has also discussed the education of us domestic
pyromaniacs with the people who sell &quot;solid fuels&quot;.
  With the use of such fuels still growing spectacularly, it is proper
that our authorities should be concerned about pollution and citizens' rights.
  But it is nonetheless morbid to think that we have so civilised ourselves
that we have to be taught how to make something as instinctive as a good
fire.
  Before long we'll have to pay for a license to light one in our own hearths.
