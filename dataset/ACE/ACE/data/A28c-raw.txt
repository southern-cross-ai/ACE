	<h> Alerts at art galleries </h>
	

 ART galleries in Victoria are on full alert following the Picasso thieves'
warning that they intend to carry out their second terrorist act.
  A burnt match, which accompanied the Australian Cultural Terrorists' third
ransom letter, has indicated that other valuable paintings in the State
are at risk from the group still holding Picasso's Weeping Woman, taken
from the National Gallery nine days ago.
  Security measures have been tightened by order of Police and Arts Minister,
Mr Mathews, who fears the theft and ransom campaign will be stepped up.
  Gallery directors, the State Public Service Association attendants and
police are reviewing all security procedures to stop any further art treasures
disappearing.
  The Australian Cultural Terrorists have not been out of the headlines
since stealing the $2 million masterpiece in a bid to get the State Government
to inject more funds into art.
