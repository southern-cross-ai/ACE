BRUCE DOVER (Sun Weekend, May 24) never heard of the 12th Australian Infantry
Battalion in Vietnam. The 1st Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment, captured
that tunnel system in the Hobo Woods in January, 1966. The tunnels didn't win
the war for the enemy. We beat him every time. It was the gutless civilians
back home.
