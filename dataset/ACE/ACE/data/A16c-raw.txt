	<h> From drought to tourist flood </h>
	


	<bl> By MARK HOOPER </bl>
	

THE Big Drought of 1982/83 broke the spirit of many people on the land,
but it was also the catalyst for some entrepreneurial spirit.
  Such is the case with Antony and Heather Heath of Bairnsdale.
  The downturn in their sheep grazing and shearing activities during and
after the drought forced them to look at alternative sources of income.
  Selling the farm was out because of the family tradition and their love
of the land.  So they decided to take advantage of one of the few things
not affected by the drought - the main road.
  The Heath's 300 ha property, called Redcourt, borders the Princes Hwy
10 km west of Bairnsdale.
  From their farmhouse near the road, they could see the drought wasn't
stopping hordes of travellers to Lakes Entrance, Mallacoota, the high country
around Omeo and the south coast of NSW. 
  So they jumped on the bandwagon and started a tourist attraction of their
own, the Redcourt Woolshed, designed for city people and overseas travellers.
  The Woolshed provides visitors with a demonstration of shearing, wool
sorting, four different breeds of important Australian sheep, sheep dogs
in action, and a small museum.
  The idea was not new, but it was borne of some desperation during a bleak
period in Australia's rural history.
  And there is a constant flow of tourist coaches, many of them carrying
travellers from overseas, to the Woolshed.
  Mr Heath does the shearing and he clearly revels in the opportunity to
show off the skills and importance of the wool industry.
  &quot;It was a case of us trying to diversify, helping bring the country
and city closer together, and it has worked,&quot; Mr Heath said.
  &quot;People can wander around the property and be close to the sheep and the
dogs and what happens on the farm.&quot;
  The Heaths' commercial concerns have also picked up over the past few
years and their tourist considerations had to be cancelled last week as
the shearing of Redcourt's 3000 fine wool Merinos was done by a local team.
