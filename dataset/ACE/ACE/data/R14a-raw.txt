	<h> Gypsy The Punter </h>
	

  According to Doug, Gypsy was a good punter with a bad memory, but could
remain poker faced for many hours, and really expected all concerned to believe
his statements.

  After the races had finished, Doug met Gypsy at the local hotel.

  Doug asked Gypsy how he had fared with the bookies. Gypsy said, &quot;Won a
'hunned', Doug.&quot; Doug replied, &quot;Well done, old mate,&quot; then moved off to have
a few beers with the chaps he had entered the bar with.

  A couple of hours later Doug was moving around a little in the bar and
heard Gypsy telling a chap, &quot;I won a couple of `hunned' today, mate.&quot;

  About ten o'clock Gypsy was getting a little the worse for wear and started
moving about, having a chat to different people. He had a cigarette in one
hand and a ten ounce glass of beer in the other and was at this stage, spilling
more than he was drinking. He was getting close to Doug, so Doug thought
that he would get in first, &quot;You had a good day, eh mate?&quot;

  Gypsy slurred, &quot;Won five `hunned' Dougie, five `hunned'. Hey Dougie, could
you lend me fifty 'til next week?&quot;
