	<h> All talk, no contracts </h>
	

  THINGS are tough these days for radio's growing legion of talking heads! 
  Except for the people at 3AW, no open line gabsters in Melbourne commercial
radio have contracts.
  Even 3AK's highly paid breakfast man John Blackman admits he's on a
hand-shake agreement ... and 3DB supremo Bert Newton is also on a week-to-week
deal.
  Whatever happened to the good old cast iron, long term contract of
yesteryear? 
  Maybe managements got sick and tired of writing massive severance cheques
for overpaid &quot;names&quot; that never quite cut the mustard on air.
  I could think of a few who have found themselves out on the pavement much
richer for having poor ratings.
  The last contract personality on DB was aggressive drive time host Bill
Tuckey, who was axed recently, but not for low ratings.
  Meanwhile, things are a little more relaxed at AW where the station has
had a long run at the top of the ratings.
  It would be hard to imagine the ubiquitous Hinch without a solid gold
agreement ... and breakfast pair Bruce Mansfield and Darren James have
scored well enough to have the station willing to tie them up.
  Otherwise contract lawyers aren't getting much business in the wunnerful
world of wireless these days!
