	<h> Deregulation: the tough get going </h>
	

In 1903, seventeen independent owners published twenty-one capital city
dailies. By 1982, the number of newspapers had dropped to seventeen, and
the number of owners to three. This massive concentration of ownership of
the press has also happened in radio, television and, most recently, satellite.
The `Big Four' - Herald and Weekly Times, Consolidated Press, News Corporation,
and John Fairfax, continue to expand and consolidate their powerful empires
- and the government has done nothing to stop them. What this means for
us all, as media-consumers, is critical. Liz Fell, a keen and critical watcher of
the Big Four's maneouvres, looks at some of the issues.
