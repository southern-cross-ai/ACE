 A new national body is likely to be established next year
to control telephone tapping on behalf of State Police and the National
Crime Authority as well as Federal Police.
  The move would amount to an extension of official phone-tapping powers
to fight major crime, but would prevent the control of taps passing to State
police forces or the NCA.
  The establishment of a single national authority to control taps - which
would still need judicial warrant to begin - is a compromise solution to
a long debate about the civil liberties dangers of extended tapping powers.
  It is believed to have emerged from a parliamentary joint committee
on telecommunications interceptions which is due to report to Parliament
later this week.
  Government sources said yesterday that although the national agency idea
was not an ideal solution, it would probably prove an acceptable way out
of a difficult problem.
  The Federal Opposition, the National Crime Authority and some others
including former Painters and Dockers Royal Commissioner, Mr Frank Costigan,
have all argued for the full extension of phone-tapping powers to State
police and the NCA.
  On the other side civil liberties groups, the Australian Democrats and
the Federal Labor Caucus have voiced strong concern about the threat to
rights.
  In June this year Caucus succeeded in having legislation which would have
extended some tapping powers to State forces and the NCA sent to a joint
select committee.
  It is that committee which is due to report this week, and all factions
of the ALP are expected to be in the majority which will want the new agency.
  This is an indication that changes to the legislation stand a good chance
of winning Caucus approval.
