	<h> CASUARINA SITE A MISTAKE, SAYS LIB. </h>
	

OPPOSITION front-bencher George Cash has derided the State Government's
decision to build a new $53 million maximum-security prison at Casuarina.
  The decision would waste taxpayer's money and create a security risk,
he said.
  He called a press conference yesterday after spending the morning at
the Canning Vale Prison complex - a site that he favours for the new prison.
  Mr Cash, the Opposition spokesman on prisons, asserted that the
Government's decision to build the gaol about 5km east of Medina and 4km
from Parmelia was &quot;shrouded in secrecy and deception.&quot;
  He said that questions raised by the Opposition in State Parliament had
gone unanswered by the Minister for Prisons, Mr Berinson.
  Questions asked by anxious nearby residents had also gone unanswered.
  Mr Cash said he believed that there was no sound basis for building the
gaol at Casuarina when Canning Vale was designed for a maximum-security
unit.
  He said that when the Canning Vale complex was developed by the Tonkin
Labor Government it was intended that a maximum-security prison would 
eventually be built on the land available on the site.
  It was always intended that the Canning Vale site would replace the Fremantle
Prison.
  Instead, the Government had chosen to build the gaol about 15km south.
  &quot;The fact that facilities will be duplicated indicates that taxpayers
will be paying more than is necessary,&quot; Mr Cash said.
  Mr Berinson said last night that there would be no duplication of facilities.
  He said that in retrospect the shared facilities at Canning Vale showed
unfortunate planning.
  &quot;I cannot imagine that Mr Cash should suggest shared facilities at a
maximum-security prison,&quot; he said.
  &quot;It would be a security nightmare.&quot;
  Mr Cash said that spending on a new prison site was absurd when &quot;only
two weeks ago the Premier told us to tighten our belts.&quot;
  &quot;And the fact that prisoners will have to be escorted that distance between
the two gaols represents an unnecessary security risk,&quot; Mr Cash said.
  There would be only a marginal saving in building the gaol at Canning
Vale instead of Casuarina, he said.
  However, the service facilities at Canning Vale - equipment and maintenance
- would need to be duplicated at a new gaol.
  Mr Cash said that the Environmental Protection Authority's 1981 System
Six study report recommended that the site at Casuarina be vested in the
WA Wildlife Authority because of its significant flora, fauna and water.       
  The Government appeared to be rejecting this recommendation for no apparent
reason.
  Mr Berinson said that it was a System Six area but the prison would occupy
only 30 hectares out of the 180 hectares.
