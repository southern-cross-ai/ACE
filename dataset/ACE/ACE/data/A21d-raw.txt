	<h> Council pans Sunday racing </h>
	

THE Melbourne City Council last night registered its opposition to this Sunday's
race meeting at Moonee Valley and future Sunday racing.
  Cr Bill Gardiner, moving a motion against the meetings, said trotting
at Moonee Valley caused Flemington and Essendon  serious traffic
congestion, affecting residents.
  He said Melbourne and Essendon councils had opposed the over-use of &quot;a
particular race track in Essendon&quot;.
  Cr Neil Cole said he opposed future consideration of Flemington race course
for Sunday racing.
  Council passed a motion opposing next Sunday's meeting. - Neil Wilson
