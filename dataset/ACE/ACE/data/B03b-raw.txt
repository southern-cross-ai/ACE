	<h> FRINGE FOUL-UP</h>
	

THE Federal Opposition has a golden opportunity to cash in on the mess caused
by the Government's iniquitous Fringe Benefits Tax.
  There is a growing community awareness that the tax is helping put people
out of work, and particularly hitting small business.
  Yet the Opposition seems confused about whether it should promise to amend
the tax or withdraw it altogether.
  No-one expects it to tolerate the abuse of fringe benefits. But at the
same time the FBT as it stands is unworkable and hurtful.
  If the Opposition can get its act together it can win votes. If it doesn't
it won't deserve to.
