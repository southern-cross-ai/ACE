	<h> Kuwaiti envoy forced down in USSR: Iran </h>
	


	<misc> KUWAIT, Thursday (Reuter). </misc>
	

An aircraft taking a special envoy of the Emir of Kuwait to Tehran was chased
last night in Iranian airspace by Iraqi fighters and had to make a forced
landing in the Soviet Union, the Iranian news agency IRNA reported.
  The envoy, former Kuwaiti Oil Minister Mr Abdul Rahman Salem al-Atiqi,
58, was carrying an invitation to the Iranian President, Mr Ali Khamenei,
to attend an Islamic summit meeting in Kuwait in January.
  The aircraft made an emergency landing at the airport at Yerevan, the
capital of Soviet Armenia, according to the office of the Emir of Kuwait,
Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah.
  Kuwait said it had ordered the envoy to return home.  The brief statement,
carried by the Kuwaiti news agency Kuna and broadcast on state-run Kuwait
Television, said the pilot had been instructed to fly back to Kuwait.
  But there was no immediate confirmation in the Soviet Union that the aircraft
had landed there and Western analysts said the Soviet official media were
unlikely to comment until Iran, Iraq and Kuwait had made statements.
  Nor did Iraq make any comment on the allegation by Iran.  The Gulf war
between the two neighbouring countries is now in its seventh year.
  The Kuwaiti statement did not suggest a reason for the plane being diverted
by Iraqi fighters.  It said the aircraft had made a safe landing.
  IRNA said the aircraft had been trailed by Iraqi planes over north-western
Iran, forcing it to change route and enter Soviet air space.  Mr Al-Atiqi
had already visited Jordan, Iraq and Syria to deliver invitations to the
summit meeting.
  Last  Saturday Kuwait fired two missiles at an intruder and Kuwaiti
newspapers said it was an &quot;enemy plane&quot;, which was believed to have been
shot down off the Kuwaiti coast.  No wreckage was found.
  Iranian officials hinted that it was a warplane belonging to Iraq, which
has obtained billions of dollars in aid from Kuwait and fellow Gulf Arab
states during its war against Iran.
  Iraq has declared Iranian air space a &quot;forbidden zone&quot;.
