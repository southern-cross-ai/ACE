	<h> QUEENSLAND'S WAITING FOR YOU </h>
	

Queensland calls itself the Sunshine State and boasts about being Australia's
leading holiday destination. Here we show you how much Queenslanders have going
for them.

From the north-east corner of Australia, the finger pointing northwards is
Queensland. It sprawls for more than 1.7 million square kilometres, most of it
in the tropics, covering a land five times as large as Japan, one-fifth the size
of the United States of America, and equal to Great Britain, Denmark, the
Netherlands, France, West Germany, Italy, and Spain, combined.
