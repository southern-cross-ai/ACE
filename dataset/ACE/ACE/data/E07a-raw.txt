	<h> Playing house - to your own style </h>
	

	If you are restoring or extending a less than youthful house the
experiences of two families, recounted in this section, may shed a different
light on your project.
	For the home builder, a kit home is one attractive alternative.
If time and experience is short, but you still want to build your own home,
then a truckload of materials and a ready source of 'how to' advice from
a kit home specialist could be the answer. Designing, ordering, organising,
and cutting materials to length are just a few advantages offered by this
method.
	Generally, companies offer a variety of designs as well as the option
of using one of its builders to work on as little or as much of the project
as you desire.
	Many kit homes come in modules enabling the owner-builder to start
with a small, low-cost house and extend when finances allow. This is an
easier and faster way of building which still gives you that special feeling
of achievement that will undoubtedly become part of your home forever.
