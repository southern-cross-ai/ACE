	<h> Grand prix ace to miss Hardie 1000 </h>
	

BRILLIANT young grand prix driver Gerhard Berger has scratched from Sunday
week's James Hardie 1000.
  Berger's sponsor, Benetton, will not let the 26-year-old Austrian come
to Australia, fearing the pressure of a trip Down Under for a long touring
car race a week before the Mexican Grand Prix would be too much. 
  He will be replaced in the Bob Jane T-Marts BMW by German touring car ace
Dieter Quester.
  Quester is no stranger to the Bob Jane car - it's the same Schnitzer-prepared
BMW he drove to victory in the world's toughest touring car race, the
Spa-Francorchamps 24-hour, a couple of months ago.
  At Bathurst he will share it with another top European BMW driver, Roberto
Ravaglia of Italy.
  Ravaglia was rookie of the year at Bathurst last year with a second with
Johnny Cecotto in a BMW.
  The Ravaglia-Quester car will retain its BMW colors, blue purple and red,
instead of Bob Jane's familiar orange.
  A spokesman for the Bob Jane Corporation, which is running five cars at
Bathurst, said Berger had confirmed he could not make it to Bathurst due
to formula 1 commitments.
  Racing at Bathurst would have meant two Australian trips in three weeks
for Berger who often races with Ravaglia in European touring car races.
