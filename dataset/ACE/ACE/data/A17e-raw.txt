- The richest treasure ship ever discovered could yield
$2.47 billion in gold, silver, emeralds and historical artifacts, according
to a US treasure hunter.
  The Spanish ship Nuestra Senora de la Maravilla sank along the Bahama
Banks in 1656 with Central American treasure bound for Spain.
  Herbert Humphreys Jr said the wreck was covered with 15 metres of sand
but divers had uncovered emeralds, gold and silver coins and priceless Ming
Dynasty porcelain.
  Records show the ship also carried 30 to 40 tonnes of silver and a solid
gold metre-tall statue of the Madonna.
  In the early 1970s, a few million dollars of treasure was recovered.
  Many of the finds will go to public museums as well as Humphrey's planned
maritime museum.
