	<h> Triumph for the refugee </h>
	

  When Phnom Penh fell to the Communists, thousands of refugees streamed
out of the Cambodia capital seeking safety on foreign shores.
  AMONG the desperate folk who were to be described generally as &quot;boat
people,&quot; there was a little girl named Liun Yann. 
  The nine-year-old and her family of six sought refuge in America, stumbling
bewildered into a land only a little less frightening at first than the
war they had just escaped.
  The story of Linn is told in the new release movie from a new label -
THE GIRL WHO SPELLED FREEDOM, on the Disney Premier Cinema cassette.
  Linn slowly finds her way as a new American, but there are still shadows
of war which haunt her.
  Helping to combat them in this film are Wayne Rogers (well known in M.A.S.H.)
and Mary Kay Place as George and Prissy Thrash, the Cambodian family's
sponsors. 
  Well made and with a lot of compassion, The Girl Who Spelled Freedom is
good family viewing.
  Interest at the end also, as Rogers becomes interviewer and talks to
the real Linn (played in the film by Jade Chinn) and the Thrash family.

  -TOM HANKS, Lori Singer and Jim Belushi combine talents for the CBS-Fox
cassette THE MAN WITH ONE RED SHOE and succeed in entertaining us no end.
  A trifle slow to get moving &quot;shoe&quot; is a comedy cum undercover tale about
an innocent musician caught up in the middle of a crazy conspiracy.
  Lori Singer (The Falcon and The Snowman, Footloose) plays the beautiful
spy who falls for Hanks and goes out on a limb to save him from the CIA.
  Some faces you'll recognise make up the rest of the cast, including Carrie
Fisher, Dabney Coleman, Charles Durning and Ed Herrman.
  You'll enjoy this comedy of errors from CBS-Fox.

  -ATTITUDES to custody, access rights for men and the non-rights of defacto
parents are addressed in the powerful film JENNY KISSED ME out on
RCA/Columbia/Hoyts cassette.
  Starring Ivar Kants as Lindsay the defacto father, Deborra-Lee Furness
as Carol the reluctant mother and Tamsin West as Jenny, Jenny Kissed Me
is about a loving parent-child relationship between Jenny and Lindsay and
their search for each other when Carol leaves Lindsay.
  The film also looks at other important contemporary relationship issues:
managing as a single parent, the bloody mindedness (for whatever reason)
of parents when it comes to custody and access, lack of communication and
being a mother unable to cope with this responsibility.
  A well-made drama to tug the old heartstring.
