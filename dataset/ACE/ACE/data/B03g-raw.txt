	<h> TAX CUT RORT</h>
	

THE idea raised in Canberra of postponing tax cuts for higher and middle
income earners from September 1 will undoubtedly appeal to the Government.
  Keeping the 60, 48 and 46 per cent marginal rates would give the Government
considerable extra revenue. 
  But the whole idea of reform is supposedly to:
  REDUCE punitive tax rates which discourage hard work and enterprise;
  COMPENSATE people for other tax measures like the Fringe Benefits Tax;
and
  GET RID of unjust anomalies in the system.
  To retain the high tax rates even for a few months would be a unfair -
a cynical tax rort.                                               
  And it would certainly encourage tax evasion and avoidance and further
erode what little economic credibility the Federal Government has left.
