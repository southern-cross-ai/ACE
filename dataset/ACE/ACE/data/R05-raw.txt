	<h> CATHOLICS AND PUBLICS </h>
	

Publics are unfortunate children who have not been given the gift of the
Faith. It is hard to say whether or not they are at fault, or whether they
are simply victims of the crass ignorance of their parents. They are more
to be pitied, really. They are rude and swear at their teachers, and attend
State schools. Occasionally, a public becomes an honorary Catholic and
is permitted to attend a Catholic school. This is often the case with Jewish
children (who are never real publics in the true meaning of the word anyway)
and Greek or Russian Orthodox children. Sometimes the parent of a public,
alarmed at the recent attempted murders at the State school, will enrol
their child, but as a general rule of thumb, publics attend public schools.
  In an attempt to emulate the Catholic school system, certain publics got
together and formed the GPS schools. Sometimes they win the Head of the
River and they have been known to do quite well in other areas of sport.
But they are hopeless at handball and this is why the great GPS sporting
events always omit this difficult Catholic sport. One of the ways to tell
an old Catholic schoolboy is to look at his wrists. Old scar tissue there
indicates eleven years of handball. 
  Female publics chew gum in public and wear very short tunics. They pull
their belts in far too tight and have long red nails. Catholic school girls
should remember that there is always an Old Girl on the train ready to report
them if they should ever display these characteristics. This is why a change
in the school uniform is always so welcome. That cranky woman in the corner
of the carriage might well have been the head of a convent school in '36
but if the uniforms have changed twenty-seven times since then you're
reasonably safe. Some publics become very rich and then they often tempt
Catholic girls to marry them. To avoid this sort of thing, it is best that
you keep right out of their way, otherwise you might end up in a family
with a Mixed Marriage.


	<h> TIPS FOR CATHOLIC SCHOOL-LEAVERS </h>
	

After you leave school, you may hear of something called the Reformation.
Be on the safe side and ask a priest about it. Basically, it came about
because of the rebel and heretic, Martin Luther, and the sins of Henry the
Eighth against the Sixth and Ninth commandments. This is why Catholics
have the Pope and why the Pope doesn't even have one wife. Any questions
you might have concerning history, philosophy or science should always be
discussed with a Catholic adviser. Similar prudence should be used if you
ever see a Bible.
  When forced to take secular, external Exams:

2 Always refer to Catholics as &quot;Papists&quot; or &quot;Roman Catholics&quot; not &quot;we&quot;
  or &quot;us&quot;.

2 Call the Pope &quot;the Pope&quot; and not &quot;Our Holy Father&quot;.

2 Refer to the English, the Dutch, the Germans, etc. as &quot;the English&quot;, &quot;the
  Dutch&quot; and &quot;the Germans&quot;, etc. Do not lump them all together as &quot;the
  heretics&quot; or &quot;the Protestant forces&quot;.

2 Protestants will often try to embarrass innocent Catholics by bringing
  up the matter of the Inquisition. Do not be alarmed. Allude to Marx and
  the necessity for a thorough going-over of an institution every once in
  a while. (It's quite okay to do this; you are permitted to use one enemy
  to confound another.)

2 Remember to use your initial only if your first name is Kilian, Polycarp
  or Aquina.

2 Do not write &quot;Ad majorem gloriam Dei&quot; across the top of every page. God
  will understand.

2 Pray to St Jude, hope of the hopeless, if there is a heavy weighting given
  to the topic of the Reformation or the Inquisition on the exam paper.
  A novena beforehand should have prevented this from happening in the first
  place.


	<h> NUNS </h>
	

Tiny First Graders dressed in tunics and regulation white shirts have little
idea of what they are getting into. Known to terrify even the bravest child,
from day one nuns are a complete mystery. Some even have men's names. But
they are a fact of life for children of the cloth.
  Nuns practised behaviour modification ages before it became trendy. Quickly,
Sister's students learned to follow her instructions, and thus the path
to Heaven, on threats of swats from the ruler for so much as a sideways
glance. The good nuns, who jingled their rosary beads to let you know they
were coming back into the classroom so they wouldn't catch you misbehaving,
were few and far between.
  Early in the school year, good girls and boys learn that God or Sister,
or both, is always watching, so they do what they're told and nothing else.
They quickly learn it is a venial sin to draw a picture of Sister Gabriella
with her eyes crossed. Minor infractions such as these can be cleared up
with a visit to the confessional, a good Act of Contrition, and collecting
more money for Black Babies than anyone else in the class. The prize, a
little Pellegrini madonna, is a bonus.


	<h> THE SPIRITUAL BOUQUET </h>
	

What is a Spiritual Bouquet? A Spiritual Bouquet is a transferable gift-voucher
of a spiritual nature, made up of masses, prayers, rosaries and other works
of devotion. The benefits accrued by these pious activities are automatically
transferred to the recipient of the Spiritual Bouquet in much the same
manner as the piles of gold ingots are moved around Fort Knox, from one
country's pile to another's during international monetary transactions.
But the treasures are infinitely more valuable than mere metal and the
Spiritual Bouquet makes a good, inexpensive gift if you've spent all your
pocket money on fun parlours or cigarettes. A typical Spiritual Bouquet
might be as follows:
  
	<misc> For your intentions, I have offered up </misc>
	

  
	<misc>3876 ejaculations (aspirations) </misc>
	

  
	<misc>562 Hail Marys </misc>
	

  
	<misc>746 Glory be's </misc>
	

  
	<misc>198 Our Fathers </misc>
	

  
	<misc>74 rosaries </misc>
	

  
	<misc>69 masses </misc>
	

  Ejaculations are short prayers such as &quot;Jesus, Mary and Joseph&quot;. They are
often known as aspirations and this means the same thing. When you add up
all the indulgences that these prayers attract, you'll realise that what
you're giving the recipient is an early release from Purgatory similar to
the government's early release plans for model prisoners. The invoking of
the Holy Name alone is worth three hundred days. Try remembering this next
time you have a severe fright. That way, instead of being guilty of blasphemy,
you can add another three hundred days to your time out of Purgatory.
  When you have tallied up all the devotions, it is usual to make a pretty
little card decorated with drawings of angels, lilies and other heavenly
motifs. Roses are also very popular. You should have the boxed set of Derwent
coloured pencils for this exercise, with gold and silver coloured pencils
for the angels' halos and the dewdrops on the heavenly flowers. Lakeland
colours will do at a pinch. A generous Spiritual Bouquet given to an aunt
for Christmas can often result in the desired boxed Derwent set next year.
  While we're on the subject of indulgences, let's clear up two troublesome
misconceptions that cause confusion for Catholics and non-Catholics alike,
and having done so, they can be completely forgotten, as they both invariably
are. First, indulgences. A three hundred day's indulgence does not refer
to time off a sentence to Purgatory. What it amounts to, is this: A long
time ago, the fathers of the Church, concerned at the number of wailing
penitents crawling up the steps of Chartres Cathedral on their knees and
beating themselves with whips (the usual sort of penance after Confession
in those days) decided to improve traffic flow here and at other religious
centres. (Kids have it easy these days. Just imagine having do do one of
the old sorts of penance instead of a few quick prayers. Your mother would
know what you'd been up to if you had to stand in the Devonshire tunnel
for a year and collect alms.) So what the Church fathers did was to make
up a standard, not unlike the gold standard briefly referred to above. Instead
of, say, begging outside an inn for a year, they worked out that certain
prayers were the spiritual equivalent of such a penance. This cleared
congestion around cathedrals and inns and probably reduced the number of
beggars around in earlier times. No doubt, too, it improved the economy
as men and women were able to stay in the workforce instead of travelling
to the Holy Land on their hands and knees. The problem with this change
was that no one really believed that a single rosary was the spiritual
equivalent of a real, old-fashioned penance, such as scourging yourself
for three years at the cross roads, and so this &quot;time off Purgatory&quot; confusion
has persisted.
  The other troublesome misconception refers to the Immaculate Conception.
This does not, as is widely believed, refer to the conception of Jesus,
but to the Blessed Virgin's unique status as the only human conceived without
Original Sin on her soul. This is all explained quite clearly in the Green
Catechism as a &quot;singular privilege&quot; and in no way establishes a precedent
just because your name is Mary or you see an angel. These two important
facts should be forgotten as soon as possible as they are by good Catholics
everywhere.


	<h> FIRST HOLY COMMUNION </h>
	

Nuns tell you it's the happiest day of your life. Parents beam at you proudly,
momentarily forgetting that you broke the lamp playing indoor basketball
last week. Greeting cards, often containing money, arrive in the mail for
you. 
  The cause of all the merriment? Your First Holy Communion.
  Heart, soul and body have undergone intense preparation for this sacred
event. For weeks, catechism class has consisted of pre-Communion drills,
to the extent that you can pronounce &quot;transubstantiation&quot; and almost
understand what it means. Father has been visiting your Third Grade classroom,
simulating what will happen on The Big Day. As each name is called, a child
walks slowly up to the front of the classroom, hands praying reverently,
fingertip to fingertip, and head bowed slightly. Then Father places an
unconsecrated host on the child's outstretched tongue. After a brief pause
and thoughtful Sign of the Cross, the recipient shuffles back to her seat.
  By the day the Day of Days arrives, your class is well rehearsed, yet
someone always faints or vomits because of all the excitement. Parents act
understandingly, but they're usually annoyed because they've gone to all
the trouble of dressing you up. Girls look like little brides of Christ
outfitted in pristine dresses and veils, clutching shiny new rosaries, prayer
books and pocketbooks. Little boys in white suits look like page boys at
a wedding. In the eyes of teachers, parents and relatives, however, on their
First Communion Day, all little boys and girls are angels.


	<h> DO-IT-YOURSELF PLAY MASS KIT </h>
	

Catholic children, like any others, need diversions on rainy days. There
is no better way to keep youngsters amused, while at the same time instilling
traditional Catholic values, than by playing Mass. Parents should not be
concerned that Play Mass is sacrilegious. Thousands of priests started out
this way.


	<h> MATERIALS NEEDED FOR PLAY MASS </h>
	

Bath towels (St Mark's brand preferred) become colourful priestly vestments.
Usually, the eldest male child plays the priest. He wraps a bath towel around
his waist and drapes another over his back, securing it in front with a
big safety pin. Younger siblings, male or female, attend as altar boys.
They may also wear towels, although this is optional.
  A card table is easily transformed into the altar. Cover with a sheet
and decorate with Sick-Visit crucifix set, a Missal, and salad-dressing
cruets.
  A shoe box covered with a hand towel makes a fine tabernacle.
