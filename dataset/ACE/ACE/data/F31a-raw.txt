	<h>- PART 4
NECK AND SHOULDER MASSAGE </h>
	


	<bl> By Ralph Hadden </bl>
	

  What with driving cars, long hours at an office desk and all the slings
and arrows of daily life, we all know neck and shoulder tension. As a
professional masseur I find that every one of my clients has experienced
tension there, and needs the relief of massage - massage to undo the knots,
relieve the tightness and pain, and loosen the locks.


	<h> The Neck, Shoulders and Upper Back </h>
	

The neck and shoulder region is vital and central to the body's functioning.
The neck is the all-important link between the head and the body, mind and
feelings, major sense receptors and means of locomotion. We turn around
on our neck and upper back to point our major sense receptors towards what
interests us or, if we feel over-stimulated or overstressed, we create muscle
tension to resist movement and prevent ourselves from turning.
  The configuration of this region reflects our life history. Hunched
shoulders, for example, may indicate that this person, as a child, was
frequently hit by a parent and they may be hunched as if anticipating
the next blow. If our life was very frightening we may pull the head back
in fear, using chronic tension in the neck to maintain our `safer' position,
or we may compensate by thrusting the head aggressively forwards. Someone
who is figuratively a `pain in the neck' - a nagging nuisance - may, if
we look into it, become literally a pain in the neck.
  Our shoulders and upper back are where we `shoulder our responsibilities'
and we may droop or sag or stiffen under these. Unexpressed anger and
frustration can also store in this region.
  When the area is functioning properly it is fully mobile, enabling full
expression of ourselves and flexible response to the world. Massage to this
area will help it to become free.



	<h> The Massage </h>
	

This massage will follow the three-level pattern, as mentioned in the first
article in this series (Nature &amp; Health, Vol. 6, no.4). As I explained then,
massage is best done working progressively through three different levels
of pressure - surface stroking, intermediate level kneading, and deep pressure
- and should then be completed with soothing stroking again. We'll also
add some other strokes to round out the massage.
  In the other articles in the series I've described massage with the recipient
lying down, but this time we'll do it a different way - sitting up. Though
the recipient is not as relaxed in sitting as he or she might be lying down,
there are advantages to this sitting massage:


	<misc> 2It's easy to do in everyday situations 
  - office, living room or bus stop(!)
  - and no special equipment or setting up is required, just a chair </misc>
	


	<misc> 2No oil is required </misc>
	


	<misc> 2For someone not used to massage this is an easy way to introduce them
to the experience - they don't have to undress or lie down, and it's very
satisfying </misc>
	

  Before you try the techniques described below, first of all try massaging
your own neck and shoulder region - feel into the muscles and notice where
you feel tight and notice what feels good to do to yourself. This self-massage
is not only good for you, it also gives you an understanding of what your
partner will feel when you apply massage.
  Remember that this part of the body can carry a lot of tension, so don't
aggravate that by massaging in an agitated or rushed manner. Take it slow
and steady.


	<h> Preparation </h>
	

As usual with massage it is best, if possible, to be in a quiet place without
distractions, though this is not so crucial with the sitting massage.
  Have your partner sitting comfortably on a straight backed chair, without
arms (they get in the way) and with a firm seat (you don't want your partner
sagging as you press). Check whether your partner has any recent injuries
or problems that require careful attention.


	<h> Beginning </h>
	

Consciously relax and settle yourself. Rest your hands on your partner's
shoulders (a good neutral point for making initial contact) and be still,
being aware of how your partner feels. Give a soothing stroking to the whole
area - upper back, shoulders, neck, head.


	<h> Kneading </h>
	

Knead and squeeze the neck, shoulders and upper back with both hands. Aim
to grip a broad area of muscle each time, and apply the squeeze firmly and
slowly, and release it slowly.
  The area between the neck and shoulder (the trapezius muscle) feels great
with this stroke, so give it a good squeeze, using two hands on the one
side (see fig.1).
  Now give a squeeze to the `shoulder pad' (deltoid muscle).
  On the upper back you can't grip much flesh, but just knead as much as
you can.
  Now work on the muscles at the back of the neck (again a much appreciated
stroke) by tilting the head slightly forward, steadying the forehead with one 
hand and squeezing as if gripping the scruff of the neck (as you would pick up
a puppy). (see fig. 2). Check that your partner feels comfortable with this
stroke.


	<h> Deep Pressure </h>
	

With the thumb, or tips of the fingers, press into the soft tissue just
below the bony occipital ridge (base of skull) at the top of the spine,
and one or two inches either side (fig 3). Work only on the back of the
head and neck, not to the sides which are more vulnerable. On each point
press in slowly, hold, then slowly release - this should take about the
same amount of time as an out-breath. Continue with deep pressure to work
on the muscles running beside the spine in the neck and upper back. Press
down on the muscles between neck and shoulder and into any other muscle
areas of the upper back as needed.
  

	<h> SENSITIVE MASSAGE </h>
	

Be careful. The deep pressure work is most effective, but can also cause
harm if used inappropriately:

  
	<misc> 2 press only on soft tissue, not bone </misc>
	

	<misc> 2 press and release slowly and steadily </misc>
	

	<misc> 2 use a strong pressure, but only as strong as your partner is able to
    comfortably receive and stay relaxed with. If you feel your partner
    tensing up, ease off the pressure </misc>
	

	<misc> 2 don't press on the sides of the neck, only on the muscles at the back
    running alongside the spine </misc>
	 

	<misc> 2 keep the head and neck alligned in a normal, straight alignment. Apart
    from letting the head drop slightly forward while working on the base
    of the skull, do not twist, bend sideways or rotate the head and neck </misc>
	


	<h> Breathing </h>
	

Encourage your partner to breathe freely while you use the deep pressure.
If a point that you're pressing on feels sore, your partner can help to
release this by breathing out as you press, feeling that they're releasing
the tension as they do so.
 

	<h> Soothing </h>
	

After the strong work you've just done, now we do some soothing massage
- some `sugar with the medicine' (but better for you than sugar!)
  Work your fingers in under the hair and massage the scalp, getting the scalp
to slide around slightly. Give a gentle upwards tug to the hair. (fig. 4).
Move to one arm, wrap your hands around the uppermost part of it, give a
slow firm squeeze, release, move down a few inches, squeeze and release
again, and so on, slowly squeezing and releasing down the arm, all the way
to the fingertips. Shake your hands loose, and repeat with the other arm.


	<h> Finishing </h>
	

Stand in front of your partner and rest your hands lightly on his or her
head. Lightly and slowly brush your fingertips down the sides of the head,
onto the neck, shoulders, arms and hands, and sweep off the fingertips.
Shake your hands loose. Tell your partner to rest awhile.


	<h> When to use this Massage </h>
	

Everybody will appreciate this massage but particularly those who are feeling
stressed in some way - frazzled by a hard day in the office, weary and tense
after many hours driving, or a parent who's fed up with the kids, for example.
Headaches can often be soothed away with this massage but be careful. If
the massage is done too strongly, too quickly or too roughly you can
make the headache worse. Check as you go along whether what you're
doing feels OK, and go slowly and calmly.
  When this massage is done well your friends will feel marvellous - it's
a great relief to have that tension massaged away, and the freedom of movement
and ease that results brings a contented smile to everyone's face.
