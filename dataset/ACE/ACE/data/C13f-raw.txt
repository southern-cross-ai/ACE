	<h> My Brother Tom: An explosive mini-series on Ten </h>
	

  Somewhere in the course of My Brother Tom, the teasing, seductive eyes
of a fresh-faced country girl turned cold and drained of happiness.
  If you watch the two part mini-series on Channel 10 next week, you will
realise what a tragedy that is.
  Based on the novel by James Aldridge, it's a story of importance, challenging
the bigotry of a small Australian country town.
  The victims of the social and religious injustice are an innocent young
couple in love, a catholic girl and protestant boy.
  Initially, the pre-war series is lighthearted and almost predictable, with
young Australians playfully racing through bushland on horses.
  The catholic/protestant line is subtly drawn.
  But as yet there is no obvious malice.
  Not until protestant Tom Quayle (Tom Jennings), the young, enthusiastic
political stirrer falls in love with catholic Peggy MacGibbon, (Catherine
McClements) do things start to get serious.
  A flirtatious tease, Peggy is rightly described as &quot;a walking temptation
to every protestant boy in town&quot;.
  But pretence falls shattered when she and Tom stand in romantic trance-like
awe, contemplating the relationship which will tear the town and their own
emotions apart.
  What a shame the series could not finish there.
  The events which follow are painful to watch.
  Not only is the couple forced to fight a town divided by religion, but
problems are compounded as their fathers indulge in a seemingly endless
feud.  
  Tom's father (Keith Michell) is a pompous English lawyer who is &quot;stuck&quot;
in Australia.
  His attitude to life rubs hard against Tom and the rest of the town.
  Peggy's father, Lockie MacGibbon (Gordon Jackson) is a direct contrast
of character.
  The likable gambler, boxing promoter lives by his wits and is quick to
mock things protestant.
  But as stirring as the mini-series may be, it is still a program the whole
family can enjoy.
  A viewing must, My Brother Tom screens on channel 10 next Monday and Tuesday
at 8.30 pm.
