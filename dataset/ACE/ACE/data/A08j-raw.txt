	<h> HOMES: PRICE IS NOT RIGHT! </h>
	

POTENTIAL sellers appeared to be holding back on the sale of their homes,
possibly waiting for prices to pick up.
  And those who placed their property on the market were seeking a higher
price than what their home was worth, according to a national survey by
the Real Estate Institute of Australia.
  The institute commented that these owners did not seem to realise in
general prices were depressed, and in some cities still slipping downwards.
  Agents in Sydney found that the stock of houses for sale continued to
decline, with many claiming that &quot;realistically priced good listings were
very difficult to obtain.&quot;
  More than half of agents surveyed said they had the lowest number of listings
since May.
  The survey, covering the month of July, said that some agents commented
that unless vendors price their properties more realistically sales market
activity is likely to remain low.
  In Sydney, most houses sold in Sydney in July were priced between $90,000
and $110,000.
