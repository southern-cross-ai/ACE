THIS is the fourth novel by S.E. Hinton to be turned into a movie.
  S.E. Hinton is one of the most perceptive writers about young people,
their problems and the traumas inherent in growing up.
  The other three films of her books are Rumblefish and The Outsiders
(both directed by Francis Ford Coppola) and Tim Hunter's Tex, in which
Matt Dillon starred.
  Emilio Estevez, son of actor Martin Sheen, was also in Tex. And so he
became interested in the stories of S.E. Hinton.
  He wrote a screenplay for That Was Then ... This Is Now.
  The director was Christopher Cain.
  This is the sad story of two youths who have grown up together like brothers.
  They have survived some bad times in the downbeat neighborhood where
they live.
  Now they are projected through various situations and their responses
to them which hasten their growing apart and the finish of a loving
relationship. 
  Emilio Estevez plays Mark Jennings. Craig Sheffer is his close friend,
Bryon Douglas.
  Cinematographer Juan Ruiz Anchia has created striking images, particularly
in the night scenes.
  My view: Recommended.
