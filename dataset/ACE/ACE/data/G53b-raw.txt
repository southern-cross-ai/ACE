	<h> The passing of a Golden Age </h>
	


	<bl> By Peter Kirby </bl>
	

In the Australia of the fifties, sixties and early seventies, few, if any,
were contemplating making the unemployed work for their unemployment benefits,
dramatic reforms of our education and industrial relations systems, or very
large expenditures on labour market programs.
  In particular, the deficiencies in our institutions and systems for educating
and training the young did not matter much. A buoyant labour market took
care of the problem.
  The common experience for teenagers on leaving school was to go into full
time employemnt. Of the total employment of teenagers only 8 percent was
in part-time work. Even after the major expansion of post-secondary education
in the sixties, and a long period of rising retention in secondary schools
and increasing participation in higher education, a majority of teenagers
still went to full-time work after leaving school.
  The changes to our circumstances since the early seventies would not have
seemed credible to us just over a decade ago.
  The world has become far more competitive for Australia. The loss of the
overseas markets, increased international competition, technological
developments, low birthrates, reduced immigration and an ageing population
among other things, have shown up a number of deficiencies in our systems,
institutions and approaches for educating and training Australians.
  We can see that through all the changes we have preserved an educaiton
and training ideology which was so beautifully summed up for us in the 1985
OECD report on our youth policies:
2  &quot;A system founded on the dangerously obsolete notion of an economy
requiring a small majority of professional and skilled trade workers and
a large majority of semi-skilled and unskilled workers.&quot;  
  Today some of the most pressing educational needs involve people outside
of the formal education structures, who have no prospect of getting in.
