 Briton Nigel Mansell romped to a convincing victory in the Portuguese
Grand Prix at Estoril yesterday and put himself within one race of the
world drivers' championship.
  Title leader Mansell led unchallenged throughout in his Williams and was
rewarded with a 10 point buffer at the head of the standings.
  World champion Alain Prost of France took advantage of a late spin by
Piquet and a seemingly empty fuel tank suffered by Brazilian Ayrton Senna
on the last lap, and squeezed home second in his McLaren.  Piquet (Williams)
and Senna (Lotus) finished third and fourth.
 Australian Alan Jones (Haas Lola) spun out of the race early on.
