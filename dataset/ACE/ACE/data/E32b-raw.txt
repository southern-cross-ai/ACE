	<h> Building Societies changing their act </h>
	


	<bl> By David Macoboy </bl>
	

Financial de-regulation has created new pressures and new opportunities
for finance professionals everywhere - but nowhere so decisively as in 
building societies.
  Building societies as we know them are an endangered species. Within five
years, some may still survive in name, but they will bear little resemblance
to the placid creatures that grew and bred so profusely in the lavish pasture
of financial regulation.
  Nobody will feel that change so acutely as the building society executive.
It will involve not just a change in attitudes and philosophies, but honing
up a whole range of previously under-used skills in risk management and
marketing. The opportunities it creates are every bit as great as the
pressures.  
  To explain why the change is so dramatic, we need to look at the
environment in which building societies grew.
  After World War II there was a chronic shortage of housing finance - indeed,
there was sustained demand right through the 1950s, 60s and even much of
the 70s. In raising housing finance, the building societies then had a clear
legislative advantage. The savings banks were limited to offering 3 1/4
per cent interest on savings, but the societies were under no such constraints;
they could, and did, offer up to three times that rate.
  The money poured in - and there was ample demand for housing finance.
For the building societies these were halcyon days.
  In this environment a distinctive management philosophy developed that
still owed much to the co-operative nature of societies. There was little
need for marketing, only modest need for risk management. It was a
single-product business - savings came in one door and loans went out the
other. All that was needed was to contain administration costs.
  This philosophy lingers today in some societies. It is an inward-looking
view, concerned largely with simple internal efficiency.
  Yet, for building societies, the world was turned upside down in 1982
when savings bank interest rates were deregulated. Suddenly the societies
had little advantage in attracting savings.
