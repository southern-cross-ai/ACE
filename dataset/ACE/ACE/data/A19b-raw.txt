	<h> Flare-up ugly and dangerous - police </h>

POLICE described Saturday's strife at Victoria Park as some of the ugliest
and most dangerous seen at a football ground.
  Four umpires were hit and jostled and two police injured when a near-riot
erupted near the umpires' race moments after Collingwood's one-point loss to
the Sydney Swans.
  The Sun's chief football writer, Peter Simunovich, was also attacked by
three men outside the Swans' dressing room.
  Police said the situation got out of hand when the angry crowd surged
forward and pushed two police horses together, leaving the field umpires
in front of them and the boundary umpires behind.
  A man ran up to field umpire Shane McDonald, 23, and spat on his chest.
  The man was pulled away by ground staff but broke clear to strike umpire
Peter Howe, 29, with a stiff-arm blow to the head.
  After viewing Channel 7 film of the incident, Sgt Wayne Miller of
Collingwood police believes he has spotted the man responsible.  He is
appealing for help to identify the spectator.
  Sgt Miller suffered a dislocated finger during the melee.  Sen. Sgt Ivan
Smith was treated for cuts and bruising.
  Police said a West Sunshine man had been charged for striking boundary
umpire Paul Nicholls, 33.  He has been bailed to appear in court on July 8.
The 22-year-old clerk was arrested immediately after the incident.
  Six people were charged with various offences, including being drunk.
  Sgt Miller said the man they are looking for was last seen going through
the members' area.
  He was aged 25-30, was 177-180 cm tall, of slight build, with brown hair
and a well-trimmed ginger beard.  He was wearing a scarf and blue or grey
jacket.
  &quot;It was one of the ugliest incidents we have seen,&quot; Sgt Miller said. 
&quot;There were blokes throwing half-full beer cans.  They were certainly fired
up.&quot;
  The Chief Commissioner, Mr Miller, said he expected a report on the 
incidents today.
