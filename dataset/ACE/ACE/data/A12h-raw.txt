	<h> Yass Shire to review safety of old dam </h>

  Yass Shire Council has decided to reverse an earlier decision and proceed
with a safety review of Yass River Dam, as recommended by the NSW Dam Safety
Committee.
  The shire engineer, Mr Bert Kaub, said yesterday that the council had adopted
his recommendation that specifications be sought from the committee and
a costing obtained for the review.
  The decision was prompted by the committee's fears that the dam could
burst, causing loss of life and property.
  The 60-year-old dam was built when there was inadequate knowledge of
likely floods and rainfall levels.
  According to the committee, two floods had already subjected the dam to
its maximum stress levels, and larger floods could be expected.
  The council previously rejected Mr Kaub's recommendation that the safety
review be carried out.
  He said the specifications would include such matters as the likely size
of future floods, whether the structure would hold under such stresses,
the waterproofing of the dam, the condition of the concrete and the general
safety of the structure under adverse conditions.
