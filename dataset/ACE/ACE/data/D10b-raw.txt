	<h> MARGARET THORNTON ON THE JOB IN THE DIOCESE OF NAKURU </h>
	

What ingredients go into making a good Lay Trainer, plus ...? For Margaret
Thornton it is possibly living in Kenya over almost 20 years, experience
in office administration and accounting, theological training and pastoral
experience, and not the least important, having a builder for a dad!

Designing buildings may not be No.#1 priority for Margaret, but at the Bishop's
request she consulted with the principal of Berea Bible Institute, the Revd
S Njiihia to do a floor plan for the new kitchen and dining room there.
'We often used to find ourselves poring over house plans with dad,
who used to ask us as teenagers to help him do the calculations for his
plans,' says Margaret. 'No experience is ever wasted!'

Last year, lecturing in Christian Education at the Bible Institute featured
amongst Margaret's priorities. This year she is not lecturing because she
is coaching the new diocesan Accounts Clerk and trying to get the diocesan
accounts up to date.

The thing that is Margaret's No. 1 priority, however, is Lay Training and
the Theological Education by Extension program of which she is director.
Last year David Kiiru Kamau joined her as co-worker. A former school teacher,
David also has clerical and bookkeeping training, and has a real calling
to the lay training work. Sixty or more TEE groups meet throughout the
diocese. These they try to visit regularly and travel, either by motor
cycle, car or public transport can often be hazardous. On rural roads, with
potholes and corrugations they may come home covered in red dust, or find
it takes one hour to drive 6 kilometres - depending on the weather!

The encouragements in Margaret's work are to see TEE groups, like the Gathuthi
group, increasing in numbers and enrolments, and also to have a co-worker
to help encourage the group leaders, as well as the 400 students. Without
supervision the groups soon lose heart and break up quickly.

So, for Margaret, with experience in several areas, it may not be easy to
work out the priorities, especially when each aspect of the work is important.
Probably as long as people remain the priority, the rest will fall into
place.
