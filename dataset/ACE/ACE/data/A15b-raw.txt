- Elizabeth Browne, former wife of a Tory MP, went 
to court today with her bags packed for a spell in jail - for 
failing to pay maintenance to her ex-husband.
  Outside the court she said: &quot;I just cannot believe he can do 
this to me.  He knows I have no more money.&quot;
  She owes her ex-husband $350,000 in a divorce pay-off.
  Mrs Browne is the former wife of finance company chief and ex-
Guards officer John Browne, Tory MP for Winchester.
  She was awarded a divorce in 1984 on the grounds of Browne's 
adultery.  But a judge ruled she must pay the lump-sum 
maintenance, based on her assets.
  In August she was given a 28-day jail sentence on condition she 
completed the pay-off.  She has so far paid $248,000 but still 
owes $350,000. 
  There was no hearing today, so Mrs Browne returned home to 
Chelsea.  But Mr Browne's lawyers are planning new legal moves 
and she may still end up in jail this week.
  &quot;I've paid over every penny I can raise, there is no more,&quot; she 
said.
