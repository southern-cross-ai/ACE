	<h> BOB CALLS THE TUNE  </h>

LIVE AID hero Bob Geldof has bounced back into the charts with his first
single record since his work to save the starving.
  The former Boomtown Rats singer - dubbed saint after he helped raise
millions of dollars for the African masses - saw his single This Is The
World Calling reach No 34 on the British charts in less than a week.
  In Australia the single made the top 100.
  The crusader launched his solo career in Gibraltar last weekend on the
flight-deck of Britain's biggest and deadliest warship, HMS Ark Royal.

  Gallup, who are responsible for the BBC music week national record charts,
said Geldof's record had sold about 10,000 copies so far.
  One Gallup chart-watcher said: &quot;The Boomtown Rats did not show any signs
of improving either before, during or after the Band Aid concerts.
  &quot;So in my opinion this record has got where it is because of the quality
of the music, not only because of Geldof's name.&quot;
  Geldof, 34, who recently married Paula Yates, his long-time lover and
mother of his two-year-old daughter Fifi Trixibelle, has spent the past
two years working for Band Aid.
  But he said he didn't get a sense of achievement or satisfaction out
of organising fundraising extravaganzas.
  &quot;With Band Aid you just logically say: `Well, this is the best way to
beat this'.&quot; he said.
  &quot;But I do get a feeling of achievement and satisfaction out of having
written a good pop song.
  &quot;With a song it's abstract, it's a risk. Every time you make a record
it's like taking an exam.&quot;
  Bob said he was astonished a few days ago when a huge crowd of girls actually
screamed at him at an airport.
  &quot;It has been a long time since anyone has done that,&quot; he chuckled.
  &quot;Usually people come up, slap me on the back and say: `Well done Bob'.&quot;
  Geldof's debut solo album, which has been produced by Eurythmics star
Dave Stewart, is expected out in Australia before Christmas.
