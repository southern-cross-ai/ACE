- Frustrated punters and horse owners now have their chance to own
a Melbourne Cup.
  The 1978 cup won by Arwon is up for sale.
  An advertisement in yesterday's Financial Review invited offers for the
18-carat gold cup.
  When Arwon (Nowra spelt backwards) won the Melbourne Cup he was owned
by a syndicate whose members included Nowra fisherman Mr Jack Watson and
Jack, Eric and Bob Doon, three brothers from Tumut.
  In 1984 the syndicate wound up and the Cup was bought by Mr Bob Doon for
$18,000.
  The 13-year-old became a NSW mounted police horse after he left racing
in 1982 with $370,000 stake winnings and now spends his time at a farm
in Bendigo.
