	<bl> BAKER'S DAY </bl>
	

  I am today reminded of the immortal words of Samuel Goldwyn:
  `What we want is a story that starts with an earthquake and works its
way up to a climax.'
  When that brewery started Fostering the Grand Prix by plastering its Blue
Thunder posters everywhere I thought it neat promotion.
  When they hoisted their banners absolutely everywhere I thought it very
neat promotion.
  Now they have wrapped the entire city in their streamers and their flags
I am awed. It is gloriously over the top.
  If I had a dollar for every Foster's badge in this city I reckon I could
buy Bond, Holmes a Court and Elliott and still have enough bucks to sponsor
the Grand Prix.
  But what prompts these reflections are the also rans. You cannot go into
a shop, a pub, a restaurant, a motel without being hit between the eyes
with Grand Prix memorabilia, from funny hats to old cars.
  Much of it is frankly commercial. There is a decent quid to be made from
funny hats. But no matter.
  For years now we have billed ourselves as the Festival State.
  But we have been too timid about it. We have whispered our wares abroad.
We have lacked conviction.
  This year, this Grand Prix, for the first time we are witnessing Adelaide
collectively selling itself with the wham, bam thank you ma'am conviction
of a New York selling the Big Apple or the British a Royal Wedding.
  At last we have learnt, with a little help from the brewers, to sell
ourselves as if we mean it. And that's more than half the battle.
  I think it's marvellous. That greatest of showmen Samuel Goldwyn would
have approved for he also is supposed to have said during the filming of
The Last Supper:
  `Why only twelve?'
  - `That's the original number.'
  `Well, go out and get thousands.'
