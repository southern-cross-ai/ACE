	<h> A.  HOW TO USE THIS BOOK </h>
	

	Have you ever wondered how many Australians pray and how often?
Have you wondered if church attendance makes any difference in the
attitudes Australians hold about various matters? What percentage of
Australians do you think consider themselves religious people? Does this
make any difference in other parts of their lives? Are &quot;religious&quot; people
different from &quot;non-religious&quot; people? Do Catholics have different attitudes
from Anglicans, or are the religious groups pretty much the same?

	How often have you had a discussion around questions like these
and wanted &quot;the facts&quot;? There is a lot of opinion about the role of religion
in Australian life. Bruce Wilson (1983) and David Millikan (1981) argue
that Australia is a secular society with a dwindling minority of religious
people. Is this correct? For a quick answer look at the major findings
(starting on the next page).

	This book makes data relevant to such questions as these available.
It is a source book of research findings about the role of religion in
Australian life. The purpose is to make the results of the Australian Values
Systems Study handy for use. With these data in hand, the reader can ask
and answer his or her own questions. For example, &quot;Does church attendance
make a difference in family life?&quot; Yes (see Chapter VII for details on how).

	This book will not stop the debate about the role of religion in
Australian society. It should lift the debate by increasing the information
on the subject. As a result there is a great deal of data presented, too
much to digest in one sitting. That is not the point. Start by looking up
a topic that interests you.

	This book does not draw out all of the implications of the findings.
Rather it is the beginning of a process which will involve many people who,
in examining these data from their own vantage points will raise different
questions and draw different conclusions. You are invited to be part of
the process of interpretation and application of these data.


	<h> B.  WHO WILL WANT TO USE THIS BOOK? </h>
	

	Who will want to use this book? Policy makers, both religious and
secular may find these data useful in forming a correct picture of the role
of religion and the future of the church. Church leaders, including both
clergy and laity may find information related to their ministry, evangelism
or church policy questions. Students of religion and society may want to
use these data in their analyses. Anyone interested in the role religion
plays in the way Australians think will find this book interesting and thought
provoking.


	<h> C.  MAJOR FINDINGS </h>
	

	There is a large amount of detail in this book. The following list
of major findings is a sensitizing guide to the data. Following each &quot;finding&quot;
will be an indication of the location of the evidence supporting the &quot;finding&quot;.
This list also acts as a highlighted summary of the study.
                           

	<h> a.  Australia is More Religious Than Many Think </h>
	

	It cannot be said that Australia is essentially secular and irreligious
when:

1.	57.9% of Australians claim to be religious persons and only 4.5%
	claim to be atheists (Table I.V.3.a).

2.	57.4% of Australians rate the importance of God in their lives as
	6 or more on a scale of 1-10. Only 13.7% rated God as 1 (not at
	all important).

3.	85.6% of Australians identify with some religious group.

4.	Two-thirds of Australians pray, meditate or contemplate occasionally
	or more frequently (Table I.B.2.a).

5.	27.1% of Australians claim to go to church once per month or more
	frequently. 20.6% claim to go weekly (Table I.B.1.b).

6.	Nearly half of those who claim to have no religion, pray, meditate
	or contemplate occasionally or more frequently (Table I.B.2.b).


	<h> b.  Denominational Identification Makes a Difference in Australian Society </h>
	

	The five groups of religious identification - Catholic, Anglican,
PMU (Presbyterian, Methodist and Uniting), RWP (theologically Right Wing
Protestant groups) and &quot;Nones&quot; (those who identify with no religious group)
- are found to differ from each other both in terms of religiosity and
non-religious attitudes. Denominational identification makes a difference
in Australian society.

1.	The RWP group is the most religious followed in order by the Catholics,
	the PMU group, Anglicans and the &quot;Nones&quot; (Chapter 1).

2.	Those who claim to have no religion are the most likely to object to a
	list of groups of people as neighbours. They are the least tolerant.
	The RWP group (conservative protestant) are the least likely to
	object. They are the most tolerant of these groups (Table V.A.1.a).
	It cannot be said that those who are religious are less tolerant
	of sub-groups in Australian society. In fact the opposite is the
	case.

3.	Conservative religious groups are not necessarily conservative
	politically (Table IV.C.1.b).

4.	Anglicans are the most willing to sacrifice for Australia and most
	committed to the monarchy. The PMU group are the proudest to be
	Australian (Table VI.B.1.b).

5.	In eight out of ten social issues measured denominational
	identification makes an appreciable difference (Chapter VI).

6.	Denominational identification is related to pronounced differences
	in attitudes toward family. Catholics and the RWP group were the
	most pro-family, least likely to approve of abortion or divorce.
	The &quot;Nones&quot; were the least supportive of family and least likely
	to object to divorce or abortion (Chapter VII).
 
7.	The &quot;Nones&quot; tend to be more hedonistic than those identifying with
	some religious group. But there are differences among the religious
	groups as well. The RWP group tends to be the most strict on moral
	issues (see Chapter VIII for specific differences).
                                            

	<h> c.  Degree of Religiosity Makes a Difference in Australian Society </h>
	

1.	Those who think of God in &quot;personal&quot; terms pray much more frequently
	than do those who think of God as a &quot;life force/spirit&quot; (Table
	II.B.1.a).

2.	Those who are more religious have a slight tendency to favour more
	conservative political parties (Table III.A.2.a).

3.	Those who are more religious are more pro-Australian and pro-monarchy
	than are the less religious (Table IV.B.1.c). See Chapter IV for
	more detailed analyses.

4.	Those who are more religious are more open to the idea of having
	persons of a different race as neighbours (Table V.B.2.b). See Chapter
	V for more detailed analyses.

5.	Degree of religiosity makes an appreciable difference in 7 of the
	10 social issues analysed. The more religious are more likely to
	consider the pace of change too fast (VI.A.2.a), are more inclined
	toward international altruism (VI.B.2.a), are more likely to think
	too much is spent on the environment (VI.B.2.a), are more opposed
	to the use and legalization of drugs (VI.C.2.c) and less likely
	to report that they drank alcohol (VI.C.3.b). See Chapter VI for
	more detailed analyses.

6.	The data show an interesting relationship between religiosity and
	family. The more religious are more likely to be married (once)
	and least likely to have lived in a de facto relationship (VII.A.2.c),
	less likely to consider marriage to be outdated (VII.A.1.c), more
	likely to have children (VII.A.3.b), slightly more likely to think
	&quot;a woman's place is in the home&quot; (VII.B.1.c), less likely to approve
	of abortion (VII.C.1.c), less likely to approve of free sex, single
	mothers and in vitro fertilization procedures (VII.D.2.a and
	VII.D.2.b), and less likely to approve of divorce (VII.E.2.a). See
	Chapter VII for further detailed analyses.

7.	Finally, the data show an interesting relationship between religiosity
	and moral issues. The more religious are more likely to take a
	traditional, conservative, pro-family stance on moral issues. See
	Chapter VIII for detailed analyses.

	Australia is not a secular society with just a few religious people
on the fringes. Further, denomination and degree of religiosity do make
a difference in the attitudes and values of Australians. These facts contradict
commonly held ideas that religion is irrelevant and of little importance
to public policy and public life in Australia. The next section addresses
some of these implications.
                      

	<h> D.  SOME IMPLICATIONS OF THESE FINDINGS </h>
	

	Four people were asked to write a brief reaction to the data in
this book. These reactions will sensitize readers to possible implications
of this study for several aspects of Christian ministry and witness in
Australia.

       	  
	<h> Implications for the Purpose and Strategy of Churches </h>
	

	The study suggests some fundamental issues about the purpose of
	churches and the strategies they adopt to achieve those purposes.

	1.   Some of the data are so contrary to conventional Australian
	     platitudes that further exploration of the issues is essential.
	     For example, those who for decades have complained of, or exulted
	     in, our &quot;secular&quot; society where &quot;religious&quot; understanding is
	     unimportant and/or declining apparently now have cause for
             reflection. That particular battle largely has been misplaced.

	     Ways of discussing and measuring &quot;religiosity&quot; that are grounded
	     within our society need to be developed rather than using terms
	     and measures that do not fully &quot;connect&quot;, or may mean different
	     things to different people.

	2.   45% of people who understand themselves as &quot;religious&quot; do not
	     or only rarely attend church. 15% of people who do not see
	     themselves as &quot;religious&quot; attend church occasionally or regularly.

	     Looking backwards, have basic goals for some churches been
	     displaced to the extent that such churches have become only
	     incidentally &quot;religious&quot;? Possibly other objectives such as
	     the search for institutional strength and extension have become
	     primary in such cases.

	     Looking forwards, there may be scope for numerous entrepreneurial
	     options in seeking to express more vigorously and clearly
	     Christian approaches that relate more closely to underlying
	     life concerns and experiences.
	
	3.   &quot;Religious&quot; people are found to be more tolerant of the
	     disadvantaged and less tolerant of the deviant than
	     &quot;non-religious&quot; people, although there are complexities in
	     the detailed data.

	     Churches that seek to follow a person described as a friend
	     of outcasts and sinners have an opportunity to exercise a far
	     stronger accepting, reconciling and healing role in our society.

	<h> Implications for Educational Programmes  </h>
	

		This book presents several challenges to those in the church
	involved in Christian leadership training, preaching, religious
        instruction, theological education or any form of Christian marketing:
	
	1.  There is something seriously wrong with existing programmes
	    if 27% of the sample are regular church-goers yet 58% regard
	    themselves as religious (alienating language, rituals and
	    structures?).

	2.  The fact that 58% of the &quot;Nones&quot; (no religion) said they believed
	    in a personal God/spirit or life force, suggests that there
	    is a ready market for the Christian religion, if only its advocates
	    and leaders learned fundamental skills of communication.

	3.  If the gospel of the Kingdom has impact on social life, then
	    it is disturbing that &quot;the most interest in politics was expressed
	    by the least religious and the atheists&quot; (p. 37). If the
	    socio-political implications of the gospel are not addressed
	    in pulpits, seminaries, Sunday Schools, small groups and RI
	    classes, how are Christians to be equipped as agents of social
	    transformation? Forms of Christian education that produce
	    socio-political quietism need to be abandoned and replaced by
	    those that promote critical reflection and transforming action
	    in an unjust world. It is embarrassing that the greatest level
	    of dissatisfaction about the way Aborigines have been treated
	    occurs in the &quot;Nones&quot; group (36% cf. PMU - 17%) )p. 47f).

	4.  If security and family life are the &quot;most highly ranked life
	    goals&quot; for Australians (p. 152), one can only deduce that 73%
	    of Australians identify most of what goes on inside church as
	    marginal to their interests. Yet clearly these two themes are
	    central to the Christian religion. Perhaps the &quot;market&quot; could
	    be recaptured if evangelism and instruction were set much more
	    in the context of the home and local community, informal
	    relationships, dialogue, inquiry and intelligible language.

	<h> Implications for Pastoral Care </h>
	

	There is a host of pastorally-relevant information within this study. I would like here simply to point to two or three issues which I believe have major implicaitons for pastoral strategy.
