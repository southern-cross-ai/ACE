	<h> Police cop a good rating </h>
	

 Ninety per cent of Australians think their State police forces are doing
a good or a fair job, according to the Gallup Poll.
  Only eight per cent said their police were doing a poor job: two per cent
were undecided.
  Tasmanians, South Australians and Victorians were all very pleased with
their police forces.
  The poll found a &quot;good&quot; rating in those States of 65, 63, and 62 per cent
respectively.
  In WA, 57 per cent gave a &quot;good&quot; response, 36 said fair and four per cent
poor.
  WA had the highest (three) percentage of undecideds.
  Satisfaction was lowest in NSW, where only 39 per cent felt their police
were doing a good job.
  Forty-eight per cent regarded police work as fair, and 11 per cent
described it as poor.
  The feeling was much the same in Queensland (40, 47, 12).
