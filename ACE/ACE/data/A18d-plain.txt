19,500 own share stake  

  THE Herald and Weekly Times had 19,500 shareholders, spread throughout
every state in Australia, at September 30.
  But Industrial Equity Ltd, Advertiser Newspapers and Queensland Press
all are substantial shareholders owning more than 10 per cent.
  The make up of the HWT share registry has been the subject of considerable
speculation and a detailed breakdown shows 17,000 shareholders own 5000
or fewer shares.
  Fifty-one per cent of HWT shareholders have held their shares for more
than 10 years.
  Further analysis reveals 9868 shareholders have between one and 1000
shares; 7344 have between 1001 and 5000 and 1368 hold between 5001 and 10,000.
  The chief executive, Mr John D'Arcy, holds 160,000 ordinary 50c shares
paid to 1c and another executive director, Mr E.J.L. Turnbull, holds 125,000
1c-paid shares.
  In September 1986 the acquisition of the Leader Media Group was paid for
by the issue of 4.85 million shares and cash payment.
  Directors said they considered it practical and prudent to acquire all
Gordon & Gotch Ltd shares.
