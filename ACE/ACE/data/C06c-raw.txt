ROBERT SPICER is a man of many parts and an author of two books before he went
to prison. Despite anticipated objections from friends, former prisoners and
prison officers, I found this third book interesting and useful.
  &quot;He only served three months&quot;, they said. &quot;He served in a restricted part of
the prison&quot;. &quot;Of course they treated him well, they knew as an author he would
write another book on release.&quot;
  But didn't Henry Lawson serve short sentences in restricted confinement?
Lawson's two famous prison poems are among the best assessments of prison life
ever written and, outside the gospels, they were my greatest help on prison
work. With these thoughts in mind, I read `Mud and Stars' and found it to be
fair, objective and thought-provoking.
  While serving his sentence for cattle-rustling in the Metropolitan Gaol,
Coburg, Spicer had an opportunity to meet and observe all types of prisoners.
Working in the officers' mess and living in &quot;Two Dorm&quot; he would have mixed with
a good cross-section.
