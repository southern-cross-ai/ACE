Costly heroics  

SEARCHING for new Everests to conquer is a perennial human obsession that
frequently results in failure - even loss of life.
  In the notoriously treacherous waters of Bass Strait last weekend, one
man's thirst for adventure led to two tragic deaths, and brought needless
grief to two families.
  Tony Dicker's attempt to row across the strait appears to have been more
foolhardy than daring, particularly as he was not wearing a lifejacket.
And in endangering his own life he also jeopardised the lives of others
- with disastrous results.
  As our report in Page 27 today acknowledges, the law cannot entirely protect
people from themselves; nor should it be invoked arbitrarily to stop people
from pursuing their goals.
  But society needs some protection from people who embark on perilous
expeditions for which they are plainly ill-equipped or inexperienced; and
there are times when rescue groups should think twice about risking innocent
lives to save people who knowingly take dangerous chances in their quest
for glory.
  It comes down to a question of moral responsibility. Anyone setting out
in search of adventure should have the sense to ensure that he or she is
not about to put someone else's life at risk.
