KINGDOM ACTION! Luke chapters 17 and 18  

1. We are to be careful about the example we set for younger Christians
(17:3) and we should always seek to enlarge our faith (17:5). Suggest ways
in which we might do both.
2. Some will find this exercise easier than others, but it is worth making
the effort. In an attitude of stillness and silence, have one member slowly
read verses 12 to 19 of chapter 17 aloud while the rest of the group try
to imagine themselves as the leper who returned to say 'thank you'. Take
time over it. Imagine the scenery, the people, the heat, the dust. Try to
see Jesus in action, and hear his voice. After a time of quiet reflection
share your experiences - what did you want to say to Jesus?
3. Where is the Kingdom of God (17:21)? Look up these passages and make
a list of other things you discover about it:

4. Bearing in mind what we learnt in point 1 above, we must guard against
pride in our 'goodness' (18:9-14). What really constitutes humility? Does
this mean that in the church we should not give credit for tasks well done?
5. Being a citizen of the Kingdom of God can be demanding, as the young
ruler discovered (18:18-30), but well worth the cost. The rich man went
away 'very sad'. What is promised to those who enter (18:30)? What does
that mean for you in the here-and-now?
6. Notice the blind man's insistence on calling out to Jesus(18:38,39).
His need was urgent as Jesus was 'passing by'. Are we too casual about bringing
our needs to Jesus?
