Trust aims to profit from imputation Peter Freeman  

THE planned introduction of dividend imputation is still 10 months off,
but at least one unit trust manager, Bankers Trust Australia Ltd, is
positioning itself to take advantage of the potential tax benefits.
  Under dividend imputation a company will pay tax at the proposed new rate
of 49 cents in the dollar, but this will then be allowed as a credit against
the tax liability of dividends paid to shareholders.
  An investor with a top rate of 30 cents in the dollar will be able to
claim 19 cents in the dollar as a credit against other income.
 The trust - launched at the start of July and known as the BT Equity Imputation
Fund - has raised $2 million and has been actively seeking shares that offer
the best chance of generating the highest imputation benefits.
  By getting in early it hopes to establish a well-balanced portfolio prior
to the expected rush into high-yielding shares later in 1986-87.
  Investors who buy units in the BT Equity Imputation Fund will be indirect
shareholders in the fund's shares and benefit from imputation, which takes
affect from July.
  Shares that presently yield 7 or 8 per cent pre-tax effectively will
give investors an after-tax return of 12 to 13 per cent as a result of
imputation.  
  But remember, it is not necessary for a local share fund to set up
specifically to take advantage of imputation since all of them will benefit
from this change.
  All that the BT fund is doing is signalling to investors that it will
be aiming specifically at taking the maximum advantage of imputation.
  As well there is always a possibility the Federal Government will change
its mind, although imputation was unaffected by the recent Federal Budget.
  Bankers Trust has attempted to lift the attractiveness of its new imputation
product by linking it with three specialist international trusts under the
banner of the BT Select Markets Trust.
