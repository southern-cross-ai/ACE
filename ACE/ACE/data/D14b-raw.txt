  Many who attended last January's United Charismatic Convention in Adelaide
may not be aware the whole event was captured on video tape by a top
professional film team.
  Up to 12 hours of video tape was put down, mixed, cut, edited and overlayed
with a multi-track audio to produce a 40 minute presentation.
  The result is 10,700 Chairs, I Think, a title gleaned from a statement
by the chairman of the convention and Tabor College director Barry Chant.
An apt title too, there were about that many chairs in the huge Wayville
Pavillion on the night of January 7 when more than 10,000 individuals took
their seats to hear some of the best Christian speakers in the world.
  Three of the best news cameramen in the country began filming the convention
long before the opening night, and the video explores the groundwork and
preparation which went into launching the biggest Charismatic convention
ever seen in South Australia.
  It also looks at the arrival of the three guest speakers - and guest soloist
- at Adelaide Airport, then moves into the yawning Wayville Pavillion before
those 10,000-odd chairs were laid out.
  The look at the behind-the-scenes operation is as fascinating as the four
day convention itself.
  A swirl of colour, a rising tide of beautiful music and the video is
eyewitness to a sea of human faces waiting in anticipation for the grand
event to get under way.
  The very best from the keynote speakers is included in the recently released
tape - Reinhard Bonnke, speaking on stage and at the open-air rally in Victoria
Square; Dr. Paul Yonggi Cho, telling of a miraculous healing; and Winkie
Pratney, who mixes the newspeak of today with the relevance of God's Word.
And, of course there is Barry McGuire urging all to join him in the story
of bullfrogs and butterflies.
  But the Jubilee Convention was more than just sermons and songs. It also
was people and changed lives. And this video cassette looks at the human
face of a mass gathering. It explores the range of emotions, the collective
worship and the response to the powerful word being delivered.
  In many respects 10,700 Chairs, I Think is a joyful reminder of a grand
and spiritual event. But it*is also jogs the memory in respect to those
telling messages that were delivered, by the world's best. It also is great
entertainment.
  Wait no more - it's now available.
