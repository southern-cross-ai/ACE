BROTHER TOM BACK AGAIN By KEVIN SADLIER  

ACTOR Tom Jennings, star of the Channel 10 mini-series My Brother Tom, will
be back on the small screen next year.
  Tom will play Greg Hudson in episodes of Sons And Daughters to be seen
on Channel 7 next year.
  Greg Hudson is described as "bright and smart" and the character will
be an important link between the roles played by Rowena Wallace, in her
return season with Sons And Daughters, and Belinda Gibson.
  Tom says he got the Sons And Daughters role almost immediately after
he had finished working on a telemovie, a thriller called Watch The Shadows
Dance, in which he co-starred with Nicole Kidman.
  And that role came after My Brother Tom.
  "There was a time when I used to work part-time as a waiter to help make
ends meet," he said.
  "Now I'm in danger of becoming a full-time actor."
  Tom, still only 20, is the grandson of veteran English stage star Patricia
Hayes and came to Australia with his family when he was 15.
  He had originally planned to be a journalist but a brief appearance in
a TV commercial when he was still at school changed all that.
  The young actor's first major role was in Mad Max III in which he played
Slake McThirst, a leader of the feral children.
