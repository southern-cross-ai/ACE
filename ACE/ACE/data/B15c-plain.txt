Yes, Bob, a new plan of `action' BAKER'S DAY  

  I WONDER what Bob Hawke was doing last night? If given proper advice he
was in front of what Clive James calls the Crystal bucket watching Yes,
Prime Minister.
  Like its predecessor, Yes Minister, this is a curious show.
  Much of it is frankly puerile, the wit not much beyond that of the average
American sitcom which is to say tailored for backward five year olds.
  But there are flashes of a cynical and brilliant wit almost worthy of
George Bernard Shaw. 
  If you are not a regular of this show it will take more space than I have
at my disposal to explain why Jim Hacker, politician, and Sir Humphrey,
bureaucrat, have arrived at No 10 Downing Street and why it should be funny.
  Suffice it to say that the best piece of advice Jim PM got on how to run
the job was to embrace masterly inactivity.
  When he questioned this pithy wisdom he was told to embrace firm masterly
inactivity.
  Through one and-a-half terms of government Bob Hawke and company have
been telling of all the great things they have done to put Australia to
rights.
  As a result we are skint, depressed and soon to be up to our earlobes
in unsold wheat.
  Which brings me back to The Lodge, Canberra, and some constitutional advice.
  Just in case he missed it I think I shall send a video recording of Yes,
Prime Minister to Mr Hawke.
  Masterly inactivity, firm or otherwise, seems to me an increasingly
attractive policy.
