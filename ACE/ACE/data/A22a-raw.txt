	<h> He's my type of man, says Joh </h>
	

THE Premier, Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen, last night said he liked and respected
Mr Rupert Murdoch and complimented him on his Herald and Weekly Times takeover
bid.
  Speaking from Weipa, Sir Joh said: &quot;Mr Murdoch's a progressive man who
has been known to myself for a long time.
  &quot;We've always got on well and I'm sure we'll continue to do so.
 &quot;He's a private-enterprise type of man and that's the type of man I respect.&quot;
  In Canberra, the Australan Journalists Association federal secretary,
Mr Neal Swancott, said the bid, coming a week after the Federal Government
announced new policies of cross-media ownership, was breathtaking in its
arrogance.           
  &quot;It can be seen as a challenge to, and a defiance of, the Government,&quot;
he said.
