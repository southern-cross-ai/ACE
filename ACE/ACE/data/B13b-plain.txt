Television news disgusting  

THE tastelessness of television news and current affairs programs has amazed
me for years.
  However, their performance of late extends beyond mere tastelessness,
and leans towards absolutely disgusting.
  Not long ago they conducted a phone-in poll asking members of the public
if they thought Lindy Chamberlain was guilty or not guilty of murdering
her baby.
  Now, in the past few days we find them asking us to play jury once again,
this time in relation to the Brian Chambers/Kevin Barlow drug trafficking
case. It would seem that television news producers see themselves in the
almighty position of judge.
  By conducting and presenting such surveys on their programs, they only
serve to try to convict the people in question, and for that I offer them
no respect. I also have no respect for those who phoned in and and took
it upon themselves to act as jury. 
  What did you hope to achieve? The decision to hang the two men does not 
rest in the hands of the Australian public, nor does it rest in the hands of 
the media.

 - Craig S. Jenkins, Binowee St, Aspley.  The same old hodge-podge  

AS I understand it, at the last State election Sir Joh and his National
Party set out to and almost did annihilate the Liberal Party - even getting
a bonus of two defectors.
  Yet despite this, the Liberals still give their preferences to the Nationals
and keep them in office. Surely they should give their preferences to any
minority party and defeat the Nationals, as they don't owe them a thing.
  Yet we are constantly hearing of another coalition, and the Liberals
will work with the Nationals. The Premier of Tasmania has been taken back
into the fold and now supports his own party, and not the Nationals.
  I am sure that there are many would-be Liberal voters who do not want
to see the old hodge-podge dished up to us again. If the Liberals have something
to offer Queensland, they should go it alone and defeat the Nationals on
merit.
  Many of us want a change of State Government to one that is accountable
to the people, and a younger Premier who will live through his decisions.
We will never get it on present Liberal policies.

 -  A. Conway, Willow St,
Biggera Waters, Gold Coast. Prices body a paper tiger  

I REFER to the intention of Australia Post to increase its charges from
August 25 with the approval of the Prices Surveillance Authority.
  In view of the alarming state of the economy, plus the almost certain
Budget blowout of up to a billion dollars this financial year, and the
Prime Minister's constant call for national wage restraint, there is every
reason for Mr Hawke to veto such a callous intention.
  Australia Post should not be exempt from exercising restraint. It should
keep within its income and defer the increasing of its presently exorbitantpresently-exorbitant
charges instead of planning for future expenditure on postal services and
capital projects.
  The Prices Surveillance Authority is only a paper tiger. It has no power
to legislate and can only act in an advisory capacity. Its weakness does
not justify its existence, as it cannot actually control prices and charges.
It appears to be just another burden on the economy.

 - J.W.Mooney, Manson
Rd, Hendra. Hard work a fact of life  

S.MOLLY (C-M, June 12) is talking through her highly educated hat.
  Surely she does not believe that working at night, working hard, working
weekends, grabbing lunch when you can, is exclusive to the teaching profession.
Let me assure you that it is part of running a small business these days.
  Like a lot of others in "the silent majority" she talks about, she probably
assumes if you have your own business you are wealthy and greedy.
  The fringe benefits she talks about relate to a small percentage, yet
she is of the opinion all business should be subject to this political tax
that will cost a lot of jobs in certain areas.
  As an employee of the Education Department, you are the recipient of
a generous annual leave scheme. You also get paid whether business is good
or bad. No risks for you!
  No borrowing money at high interest rates, no risk on mortgaging your
home, no risk of debtors going into bankruptcy overnight, no becoming an
unpaid tax collector for the Government for you.
  It is also hardly the fault of the "greedy businessmen" that you are
struggling to pay off a home, a third of your wages going in tax, and
trying to live week to week. You can blame your friends in Canberra for
that.
  As a self-employed businessman and a father of four children, for whom
I am trying to provide a reasonable standard of living, and a future, your
last paragraph is not worthy of comment.

 - Ron Franklin, Byambee St, Kenmore. Progress in education  

I WOULD like to respond to a recent article in your newspaper by Terry Black
and Norman Savage entitled "Private universities: Is this the way ahead?"
  Mr Black puts forward the absurd proposition that if full tertiary fees
were charged "there no longer will be artificial quotas stopping students
from undertaking the course they prefer", and that the "well-motivated
students" would still be keen to undertake tertiary education.
  I would put it somewhat differently. If students were forced to pay full
fees of around $7000 per year (much higher for engineering and applied science
courses), very few Australians, and then only the very wealthy, could
contemplate a tertiary education.
  Mr Black goes on to propose a loans scheme, with graduates repaying loans
based on full fees after they have established themselves in employment.
Some basic calculations based on Mr Black's loans proposal show that a loan
of $7000 per year, on current interest rates, over a four-year course could
result in repayments of the order of $700 per month for the next 30 years,
a total repayment bill of some $250,000.
  Figures for engineering and applied science would be twice this amount.
Even the wealthiest in our society would not contemplate a higher education
under these terms.
  This Government has considered and rejected the tertiary fees/loans option,
concluding that it is both regressive and a disincentive to participation.
We believe that fees would run sharply against our long-term goal of reducing
inequality in education.
  Without fees, a wider group of students apply for places, the competition
is greater and therefore performance and standards are better.
  The Government acknowledges that there is a degree of unmet demand for
higher education places, partly due to the success of our policies of
encouraging students to complete their secondary education. The main reason
is because of the backlog created by the Fraser administration. However,
most of the claims that appear in the press are wildly exaggerated.
  This Government has made significant progress both nationally and in
Queensland to increase higher education participation rates. By 1987 there
will be more than 28,000 more higher education enrolments than in 1983.
In addition, we have taken steps to redress the disproportionately low
level of participation in Queensland.
  The growth rate in Queensland's higher education sector over 1985-87
is expected to be nine percent, well in advance of the national figure
of six percent.

 - Susan Ryan, Minister for Education, Parliament House,
Canberra. They must live somewhere  

THE decision of the Redland Shire Council to bulldoze up to 400 Moreton
Bay island properties which do not satisfy building regulations is a callous
and socially-irresponsible decision.
  The same may also be said of the 122 show-cause notices served on
island property owners by the council under the Queensland Building Act.
These latter properties face the bulldozer after June 25.
  Cr John Bonney's recent remarks emphasise that the council decision will
prevent the islands from becoming "slums", discourage the sale of sub-standard
dwellings as weekenders, and clean up unsightly sheds and telephone box
lavatories.
  He did not say, however, that the council decision would also bulldoze
homes - illegal structures under the Building Act - but homes nonetheless.
This decision involves many people living in caravans or shacks while
they save the money to build a home - people who perhaps did not have the
money to erect a standard dwelling on their own land, and the squatters
who have been living in derelict structures on Crown land for years.
  With apologies to Anatole France, the Building Act forbids the rich as
well as the poor to live in shoddy buildings. The council still has not
told us what provisions (if any) have been made for these people. 
  Rents everywhere are skyrocketing. All over the city, new glass and concrete
filing cabinets rise over the demolition of older buildings, which were
low-rent accommodation. So the question remains for councils and developers
to answer: a boom for whom?
   Where exactly are these people going to live? They must live somewhere.
Why shouldn't they live on the islands?

 - Lynda Brownsey, Flaxman St. Banyo. Real reason for cheap care  

QUEENSLAND'S hospital doctors are probably the lowest-paid in Australia.
  They work long hours (more than 50 a week) with no penalty rates for weekend
and night shifts, and no entitlement to public holidays. They bear the
responsibility for assessment, diagnosis and treatment of all public and
intensive-care patients, and are repeatedly exposed to infectious illnesses.
  They are a population carefully selected for academic prowess and ability
and are paid at between $10 and $16 an hour (I net $7 per hour) - which
makes them a cheaper source of labor than nurses, cleaners and wardsmen
- all of whom are entitled to generous penalty rates.
  This is the real reason why Queensland's hospitals are so cheap to run.

 - Dr Stephen Woodford, junior house officer, Mount Isa Base Hospital. There! This proves they can read  

I REFER to John Seeck's letter (C-M, June 23) on bad drivers in Queensland.
  I thought I was the only one. Mr Seeck, you made my day. As a recent arrival
in Queensland and now a permanent (I hope) resident, I have been
flabbergasted, absolutely flabbergasted by Queensland drivers.
  But I am a quick learner. This is what I have picked up.
  - Freeway driving: 1. Stay in the right-hand lane and proceed at 5km
to 10km under the speed limit.
  2. Try to find a vehicle in the left-hand lane, drive up next to it and
proceed in tandem for the next 20km.
  3. When exiting the freeway, stay in the right-hand lane until 50m from
the exit and then pull left - don't worry about other traffic.
  - Suburban driving: 1. Stay in the right-hand lane.
  2. When the traffic lights turn green, wait 10 seconds, accelerate as
slowly as possible to a maximum of 50km/h in a 60km/h zone, and travel 10
to 15 car lengths behind the car in front.
