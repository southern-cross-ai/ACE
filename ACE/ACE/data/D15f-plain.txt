Sunday August 10 LOOK AND SEE - GOD CARES! PRAY  
Lord, help me to find your will today, and then enable me to do it.

 READ  
Psalm 33:12-22.

 THINK  
Psalm 33 speaks to us about the effectiveness of the word of God to 
express and carry out his divine will. Today's reading is particularly with his word in judgement.
  Blessed are the people whom God has chosen as his heritage (12). Christians
are told that they are blessed and know that this is true, but sometimes
have trouble in believing it! Really, this is not surprising, since we should
not expect to live trouble-free lives during this existence on earth. However,
it's often hard to believe that we are blessed in the midst of suffering
and frustration. In the parable of the Prodigal Son, the older brother feels
bitter and sees little cause for gratitude, yet his blessings shown by the
reply of his father are many - 'Son, you are always with me, and all that
is mine is yours.' (Luke 15:31). Our blessing is always there, but it does
not always consist of the tangible and material rewards by which we measure
our lives.
  The Lord looks down (13). This verse which pictures God in a rather classical
way, should give us reassurance and hope because God's concern demonstrates
his love and care.
  The war horse is a vain hope (17). Another illustration of the splendid
might of the war horse can be found in Job 39:19-25. Splendid though it
is, its power is unable to save.

 FOCUS  
How is God involved in human history (10-19)?

 MEDITATE  
I lift my eyes to the hills
          From whence does my help come?
          My help comes from the Lord
          who made heaven and earth.   Psalm 121:1,2.

 PRAY  
Dear Lord, help us to look at you, not our problems; to trust in you,
the Blesser and not in our blessings.
