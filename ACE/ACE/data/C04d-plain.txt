DON'T BE LATE FOR BREAKFAST -LISA HABERMANN  

THE Late Late Breakfast Show is pretty bizarre.
  This BBC production is also funny, entertaining and surprising.
  And lately, it has become controversial as well.
  Earlier this month a contestant, Mike Lush, 25, plummeted to his death
when a safety bracket failed in a Houdini-style stunt.
  Host Noel Edmonds admits he feels a certain amount of guilt and says there
are no more plans to continue the show on the BBC but admits Channel 10
in Australia are thinking about bringing him out here to compere a
similar-style show.
  The show premieres tonight on Channel 10 at 7.30.
