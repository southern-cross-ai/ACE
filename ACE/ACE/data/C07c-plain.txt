An African success for Simon Paul Simon is tasting worldwide success again with his latest album, Graceland.
Recorded with black South African musicians, it was a risky venture which
has paid off handsomely, as DAVID WIGG reports. 

  PAUL Simon of Simon and Garfunkel fame is back at the top as a solo star
- 16 years after his greatest success.
  Graceland, his first album for three years and considered the finest of
his solo albums, has rocketed up the charts around the world.
  Such success must bring back memories of the halcyon days with Art Garfunkel.
  As Simon and Garfunkel, they sold more than 20 million albums - their
most successful being Bridge Over Troubled Water.
  The studious looking small-framed Paul Simon and frizzy blond-haired,
lanky Art Garfunkel both became extremely rich.
  But their success only led them into their own troubled waters.
  Simon, fed-up with doing most of the work but getting less of the acclaim,
because Garfunkel usually sang lead vocal, wanted to pursue his own musical
interests. Garfunkel was drawn towards films.
  By the end of 1970, the partnership had fallen apart. 
  They went separate ways, except for one final money-spinning tour in 1982,
which ended in bitterness.
  These days, however, thanks to the success of Graceland, Paul Simon has
no doubt got over the moods of his friend from Queens, New York.
  Politically, Simon made a daring move in breaking the cultural boycott
to record with a variety of black South African musicians.
  He has been criticised as much for doing it as he has been praised.
  He only escaped official blacklisting because he visited the troubled
country to bring the music of black musicians out - and not to perform there.
  Throughout his stay in South Africa  kept an extremely low profile, avoiding
the media and spending most of his time in recording studios getting to
know some of the top black musicians.
  Simon believed black South African musicians were being victimised by
a "double apartheid" - persecuted at home and yet unable to get their music
out into the international community.
  So he went there and "exported" some of the most popular sounds and
performers to the U.S..
  Now 43, Simon lives in New York with his son Harper, 14, from his first
marriage.
  Earlier this year Simon met up with Art Garfunkel for the first time since
their last tour when he called to offer his condolences to Garfunkel's
recently widowed mother.
  "We got on well considering the circumstances were not the happiest,"
he said. "I've known Art since the age of 10 and I'm with him to the end.
Real life puts those things in perspective."
