AUSTRALIAN share markets finished the week on a firm note, unmoved by the
record one-day falls on the Tokyo and New York share markets and negative
news of Moody's credit re-rating.
  The All Ordinaries index closed only marginally weaker - down 2.6 points
at 1235.9 after a bout of profit-taking in gold and industrial shares.
  Analysts pointed to overseas buying of blue chip miners, which appear
attractive in light of a low Australian dollar, and firm gold stocks as
the main impetus for the markets resilience.
  Of note was the strength of Woolworths' share price following a 90 per
cent fall in profit for the first half.  Takeover speculation halted a share
price slide as the New Zealand group, Chase Corporation, is believed to
have added a further 2 per cent to its 3 per cent holding on Thursday when
it bought a line of 4.38 million Woolworths shares.
  Ron Brierley's Industrial Equity Ltd appeared to acquire some 724,480
Adelaide Advertiser shares on Friday, a trade representing 1.4 per cent
of the company.  This acquisition is particularly interesting given IEL's
recent purchase of a 5 per cent holding in Herald and Weekly Times.
