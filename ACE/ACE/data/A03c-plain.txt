THE NIGHTMARE WE SAW  

TWO champions of freedom have risked arrest by speaking out about the horrors
they have witnessed in South Africa.
  One chilling report came from a South African journalist who defied her
own Government's ban on releasing information to send a report to a London
newspaper.
  The second account was by the Archbishop of Canterbury's peace envoy Terry
Waite, who bravely told of "an evil which must be combatted" - even though
he knew his conversation was being bugged.
  The journalist, who cannot be named, told Mail on Sunday readers of rumors
that the Pretoria Government was planning to hire a criminal to assassinate
black rights leader Bishop Desmond Tutu.
  And she recounted a sickening scene in which a gang of children murdered
a young boy by hacking him with kitchen knives.
  When a mortuary van arrived it could not take the body away - because
it was already full of butchered corpses it had picked up on the way.
  Mr Waite, meanwhile, spoke out in a BBC interview sure to enrage the Botha
regime.
  In a phone call he was aware was being recorded by the authorities, he
attacked South Africa's treatment of its black people as "nothing short
of disgraceful".
  He added stoutly: "I am perfectly prepared to accept the consequences."
  Mr Waite, who had earlier been refused permission to visit jailed bishop
Sigismund Ndwandwe, went on: "Absolute power corrupts absolutely, and
at the heart of this system there is an evil which must be combatted.
  "People here are being detained and picked up for absolutely nothing but
doing their job as Christian ministers and Christian bishops.  The world
should know that quite clearly."
