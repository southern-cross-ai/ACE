	<h> Rare flop for ABC series </h>
	

  CHANNEL Two's &quot;A Big Country&quot; tonight is a rarity - an episode which
doesn't really work.  We have become so used to lovely, human television
from &quot;A Big Country&quot; that this one is a real surprise.
  It is called &quot;Two Women&quot;. The two in question are 21-year-old Melissa McCord,
a Sydney photographer, and Lorna Blackwell, a 72-year-old goat farmer who lives
300km southeast of Carnarvon. 
  Melissa McCord is making a trans-Australian pilgrimage, photographing
and writing about women who live in extreme isolation and often in
considerable hardship. Melissa, who wears cute little scarves and outsized
beads, is captivated by the idea.
  Lorna, whom she meets during her travels, doesn't seem to have much time
for such nonsense although she goes along with Melissa's arty photographic
posing.
  I got the feeling she thought Melissa was a bit of a twit, but was too
inherently polite to say so. And anyway, her live-in friend didn't seem
to offer much else in the way of conversation.
  Melissa McCord, whose book will be released next month, seems to have
embraced the romantic notion that all such women are heroic. No doubt some
are, but some have chosen that way of life for a good reason, preferring
the hazards of isolation to the hazards of modern, city living.
