SOME Brisbane inner-suburban residents may face a large rates jump in the
wake of 200 to 250 per cent valuation increases.
  Valuation Minister Mr Muntz released 185,000 of the 250,000 revaluations
yesterday.
  He said the increased demand and popularity of Paddington, Red Hill and
Kelvin Grove had increased values in those areas by up to 250 per cent.
  Since the last valuation in 1979, he said, the market for residential
land had been generally flat, but land prices had risen considerably since
1979 - particularly in the early 1980s.
