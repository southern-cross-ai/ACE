	<h> Crippling cost of car tax hike </h>
	


	<bl> By Mike Kable </bl>
	

Top bracket luxury cars are worth as much now - even more for the really
opulent models - as a modern, three-bedroom, suburban home.
  They are right up there in value with inner city apartments after the
Budget's sales tax hike from 20 to 30 per cent on cars costing more than
$29,649.
  Prices have gone through the roof - with motoring's ultimate status symbol,
the Rolls Royce, now costing $235,000 and the Mercedes-Benz 560-SEC coupe
soaring to $170,879.
  Australia's car importers, distributors and dealers, - who employ 17,000
people - are incensed by what they describe as a brutal, discriminatory
attack by the Federal Government.
  The latest tax increase compounds the problems caused by the dollar's
massive devaluation and the controversial fringe benefits tax.
  And the importers are rejecting the Budget estimate that it will yield
an extra $28 million a year in taxation revenue.
  They predict it will cripple sales - which have already slumped by nearly
half - and prove counter-productive.
  The higher tax, which was imposed immediately, affects more than 70 makes
and models which command about 20,000 sales a year.
  Aimed at the imports, it has also inflated the prices of two locally-built
VIP cars, Ford's LTD and Holden's Calais Director.
  BMW Australia managing director Ron Meatchem said the latest tax rise
was madness.
  &quot;It has wrecked our forward planning program after eight years of growth
in Australia,&quot; he said.
  &quot;The total effective protection percentage from January 1 last year to
now has increased from 57.5 to 182 per cent.
  &quot;Taxation has reached an absurd level.  The tax component in our 735i sedan,
which costs $90,500, is more than $45,000.&quot;
  Mr Meatchem said his parent company would make a decision soon in West
Germany about the future of its Australian subsidiary, which achieved a
1985 turnover of more than 4000 cars, but will have minus growth this year.
  The average sales tax increase over the Mercedes-Benz range is $5300, with
the least expensive four-cylinder 190E sedan at $52,864 carrying a total
sales tax component of $10,346.
  Its 560SEC coupe, at $170,879, will - if there are any buyers willing
to pay the price - net the Government $32,151 in sales tax, plus another
$40,000 in import duty, which is charged at a rate of 57.5 per cent on the
ex-factory price.
  Rolls-Royce Silver Spirit buyers will contribute nearly $100,000 to the
Treasury's coffers before driving away their $235,000 investment.
  The sales tax component alone is $44,330.63, plus $50,000 worth of duty
and several thousand dollars in stamp duty and registration charges.
