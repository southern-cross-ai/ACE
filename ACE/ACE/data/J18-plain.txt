By G.A. Mohr, H.R. Milner CHAPTER 6 Finite Element Analysis of Vibrations  

In this chapter the beam stiffness matrix developed in Chapter 5 is used
to analyse the vibrations of frames. We consider the use of both numerical
time stepping techniques, in which finite difference approximations in time
are used for the velocity and acceleration terms, and modal analysis
techniques. 
  The modal analysis method involves an initial determination
of those natural vibration modes (or eigenvectors) which have the most
significant effect on the dynamic behaviour of the structure. These are
used to diagonalise the stiffness and mass matrices and thereby transform
the problem to one of analysing a system of equivalent and independent one
degree of freedom systems, involving a set of artificial variables. The
analysis of these independent systems may be readily undertaken by such
methods as numerical time stepping techniques and Fourier type analyses.
Finally, modal analysis involves summing appropriate multiples of the various
natural modes and a transformation back to the original variables.

 6.1 Dynamic problem types  

There is a variety of forces under which structural response will vary with
time. Wind and earthquake loading are obvious natural forces and dynamic
forces from machinery are obvious man-made forces. Structural behaviour
is influenced by the structure's stiffness, mass and damping characteristics
and the nature of the forces. However, visco-elastic creep under static loading
is also a dynamical problem but, because displacements develop slowly, inertial
effects may be regarded as insignificant. Their omission simplifies the analysis
considerably and we can regard it as a special case of the more general
problem.
  The general equation governing the dynamic behaviour of a structural system
is 
  
  In equation 6.1 the mass matrix M is multiplied by the vector of
accelerations and the damping matrix C is multiplied into the vector of
velocities. Mass and damping matrices are considered later and, in this
introductory text, we restrict discussion to lumped mass systems. K is the
usual structure stiffness matrix and {Q(t)} is the vector of, in general,
time dependent loads.

 6.2 Finite difference expressions used for time stepping  

The most common method of modelling the variation of time is through the
use of finite difference techniques. We consider a variety of the more common
approximations.

 Inertial effects not significant  

In problems involving creep inertial effects associated with the mass matrix
are not significant; we require finite difference expressions only for
the velocities. In the Crank-Nicolson scheme
     6.2
     6.3
is used where δt is the time step length. The time stepping is 
centralised about   . Substituting equations 6.2 and 6.3 into equation
6.1 leads to the recurrence relation
  6.4
which is used to compute    from   . In using equation 6.4, 
Irons and Ahmad recommend that, for consistency, an equation similar to
equation 6.2 should also be used for the loads   .
  A second scheme involves using the (n1)th time instant as a
reference point, ie we write    instead of equation 6.2 and 
continue to use equation 6.3. This approximation is referred to as a backward 
difference and leads to the recurrence relationship
   6.5  
 This formula has been used extensively in transient heat flow analysis
but seems to have little advantage over the Crank-Nicolson scheme.
  A further, very similar, alternative is to use the nth time
point as the reference, ie we write    instead of equation 
6.2. This approximation is referred to as a forward difference approximation
and leads to the recurrence relation
   6.6  
If the damping matrix, C, is diagonalised by lumping the damping constants
at the nodes by intuition, the recurrence relationships, equation 6.6, become
explicit because only a trivial inversion of diagonal coefficients is required
to invert the C matrix and enable the time stepping to proceed. Although
such lumping minimises computational effort, the approach is not particularly
accurate unless small time steps are used. It can be shown that such
approximations involve a truncation error of 0δt and are equivalent to
using linear interpolation in time. On the other hand, the Crank-Nicolson
method involves a truncation error of    and is equivalent to
using quadratic interpolation in the time domain. It tends to have superior
accuracy and is to be preferred.

 Inertial effects significant  

The inclusion of inertial effects involves the use of finite difference
approximations for the accelerations and values of    at three points in
time. It is now natural to use the cantral difference method centred about
the nth time point. Considering the two time intervals,    and
   the velocities at the centre of these are approximated using
equation 6.3 giving
    
    
and the accelerations at time tn are then estimated as
    
  The velocity expressions used within equation 6.1 is not obtained from
either of equations 6.7 or 6.8. Rather, we use the centre point,   
as the point of reference giving
    
  Substituting equations 6.9 and 6.10 into equation 6.1 we obtain the following
recurrence relation
    
  This process is often referred to as one of time integration but, in fact, it
can be viewed as one of extrapolation as all the finite difference
approximations used above can be obtained from linear or quadratic
interpolations. Equation 6.9, for example, can be obtained from equation 2.8 by
replacing L by 2δt.

 6.3 Time stepping analysis of structural oscillations  

The structure of Fig 6.1 is subject to impressed boundary displacements, such
as might arise under earthquake loading, in which the ground displacement
   is a specified function of time. It is not unusual to study such
oscillations by taking into account only the horizontal displacements of the
nodes at each floor level. This implies that the bending stiffness of the floor
beams is infinite by comparison with the columns. We also neglect the
compression in the floor and roof, so that only a single displacement freedom
is needed at each level. The stiffness matrix for each column is thus a
contraction of equation 5.15 in which only the shearing entries V are required.
We sum the pair of column stiffness matrices at each level, giving 
    
  Furthermore, to simplify the analysis, we neglect damping and assume the
entire mass of the building is concentrated at the first floor and roof levels.
The concentration of mass in this intuitive fashion is referred to as lumping
the masses.
  Assembling the element matrices for each floor level and partitioning
equation 6.11 to distinguish the specified boundary displacements (subscript
b) and the free displacements (subscript f), we obtain the recurrence relation
    
  As ?b is specified the first row of equation 6.13 is all that is required
to determine ?f at each time step. Further, we can neglect the masses of the
columns or alternatively lump them together with the naturally lumped floor
masses shown in Fig 6.1. In this case the system mass matrix is diagonalised so
that    is null and both    and    are diagonal matrices. This leads to
the simplified expression
     6.14
where the first term on the right hand side gives the loading effect of the
specified boundary displacements upon the rest of the system. The matrices in
equation 6.14 are given by
    
  Substituting these into equation 6.14 and dividing through by a common factor
of 10⊃4 we obtain
     6.16
where the constant   .
  The transient boundary excitation at ground level is taken to be given by
    
     6.17b
with   . As we use a time step length of δt=0.02 secs
we would expect this to give reasonably accurate results. It follows
    
  Substituting this value of    and the specified value of    for
   into equation 6.16 we obtain the two recurrence relations 
    
  Using these results we obtain results close to the exact solution produced
using the techniques outlined in Section 6.4.
  Once the recurrence relations have been established it is straightforward
to code the time stepping solution. This is undertaken for equations 6.19
and 6.20 in Section 6.5.

 6.4 Modal superposition methods Free undamped vibrations   

Modal superposition methods are based on solutions of a simplified version
of equation 6.1, viz
   6.21  
  Equation 6.21 describes unforced and undamped vibrations of an oscillating
system having n degrees of freedom. We view the system as excited by some
initial disturbance, which causes it to oscillate freely and indefinitely,
in one of its n natural modes after the initial disturbance is removed.
  In each of these natural modes, the displacements of each node are in phase,
ie these all reach a maximum value at the same time. It is assumed that
the displacements, associated with a natural mode, can be expressed in the
form
     6.22
where       and    are respectively the angular
frequency (in radians/second), phase angle and vector of amplitudes or
eigenvector of the    natural mode. On substitution of equation
6.22 into equation 6.21, we obtain 
   
which must be true for all t values so that 
    
  Equation 6.23 is a statement of an eigenproblem described in Appendix
A. Computer routines are given there to extract the eigenvalues, which are
the square of the frequencies, and the eigenvectors or natural mode shapes.
  We should note the following additional points:
 1 the unit of frequency is Hertz (or cycles per second) and this is related
  to the angular frequency by
  
2 the period to complete one cycle of oscillation is given by
  Orthogonality and related properties  

One of the important properties of eigenvectors is their orthogonality
with respect to the K and M matrices. Suppose we have two eigenpairs
      and       then
    
  Premultiply equation 6.26a by    and equation 6.26b by
   and subtract the two expressions. Noting that K and M are
symmetric and    it follows that
    
  Since the eigenvalues are, in general, different it follows that
     6.28a
and it is supposed that, by suitably scaling   
    
We conclude from equations 6.28 that
    
  If the eigenvectors are scaled to satisfy equation 6.28b, they are said
to be normalised with respect to the M matrix; both computer routines given
in Appendix A normalise and output the eigenvectors in this form.
  Assume also that a square matrix E is constructed, the columns of which
are the eigenvectors   . If I represents the unit matrix then 
    
and   
where    is a diagonal matrix with values    on the
leading diagonal.

 Forced undamped vibrations  
When an undamped structure is subjected to the influence of disturbing forces
which are maintained, equation 6.1 becomes 
    
  It is assumed that, for an arbitrary    the displacements may be
expressed as a linear combination of the eigenvectors or natural modes.
Let this linear combination be represented as 
    
where {  } represents the various multiples of the eigenvectors to be
taken. Substituting equation 6.32 into 6.31 leads to
     
which, on premultiplication by    and the use of equations 6.30, gives
    
  In equation 6.33 the various equations are decoupled, ie these can be
separated into n single degree of freedom systems each having the form
     6.34
where   . To solve equation 6.31 we can now undertake
the simpler exercise of solving the individual decoupled equations, 6.34,
by time stepping or other techniques. The final solution is obtained by
substituting the    values back into equation 6.32 to obtain the
real nodal displacements {D}.
  In actual analyses, the problem is simpler than just outlined in that
only a few of the natural modes contribute significntly to the dynamic
behaviour, viz those having frequencies close to the dominant frequencies
in the disturbance. For example, in the well known gust factor method for
wind disturbance, only the eigenvector corresponding to the lowest mode
is taken into account.

 Damped forced vibrations  

The introduction of arbitrary damping matrices does not allow the decoupling
(described above) to take place. This means that the modal superposition method
cannot be applied in general. In practice, special forms of damping are used in
which the damping matrix is a linear combination of the mass and stiffness
matrix. For uniform viscous damping, it is assumed that    which leads
to the decoupled system.

  

Individual systems can be separated from this equation in the same manner as for undamped systems and have the form

  

If the damping is expressed in terms of the mass matrix then the damping is described as uniform mass damping and, if it is a linear combination of the K and M matrices, it is known as Rayleigh damping.
