Help for male rape victims  

A support group for male rape victims is to be set up in Melbourne next year.
  Ms Gayle McDonald, who formed a support group for female rape victims
two months ago, said yesterday she had received a number of calls from males
who had been raped.
None of the callers had been homosexual.
  "I was very surprised when I got the first calls," Ms McDonald said.
  "They are ordinary guys who have perhaps been at a party and been sexually
assaulted by other men.
  "Others have been assaulted after being at hotels or hitch-hiking, or
perhaps even at work.
  "It obviously goes on in the community to a greater degree than thought."
  The callers ranged from teenagers to middle-aged, married men.
  The Child Exploitation Unit had told her 80 per cent of the victims it
dealt with were males, she said.
  Ms McDonald said men faced many of the problems female rape victims faced
and felt they could tell no one what had happened.
  The sexual assault group can be contacted at the Victims of Crime Assistance
League office on 690-1877.
