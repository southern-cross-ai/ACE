KEN PAYS HIS DUES By TONY MEGAHEY  

It had been a while but Ken Salisbury felt at home amidst the blood, sweat
and liniment at Newtown Police Boys' club.
  The former Commonwealth light middleweight champion nodded his approval
as big Joe Bugner swapped thunderclaps with the bull-like Tongan Tony
Fulilangi.  
  And Salisbury shook his head at the sheer strength of Jeff Fenech in a 
sparring session.
  "When you've been away you miss it a lot," Salisbury said.
  "But Bugner really surprises me.
  "You've got to give it to him - he's super fit considerng his age.
  "He's worked hard at it and he'll still give them a fight."
  Then Salisbury stunned the onlookers when he produced a photo for big
Joe to autograph.
 It was the 1970 Liverpool amateur boxing and dinner show.
  Joe was presenting the trophies.
  "Joe was the great white hope then," Salisbury said.
  "And over the years I feel the man hasn't really been given his dues as
a very good heavyweight fighter.
  "I mean he took a legend the distance twice - Muhammed Ali.
  "And Bugner fought Frazier at his peak.
  "Bugner is tough - neither could put him down."  
  There's no comeback though for Salisbury.
  A car accident last year, not a pair of lethal boxing gloves, ended his
career.
  Severe neck and hip injuries make it an endurance test for Salisbury to
train.
  But Salisbury is embarking on the next best course for a man who still
loves the fight game.
  "I'm taking my exams to be a fight trainer - to put something back into
the game," Salisbury said today.
  "I'd love to work with some of the kids in the way Johnny Lewis does it
here at Newtown."
  Maybe one day Salisbury will proudly present an amateur trophy to some
wide eyed youngster.
