	<h> THE NIGHTMARE WE SAW </h>
	

TWO champions of freedom have risked arrest by speaking out about the horrors
they have witnessed in South Africa.
  One chilling report came from a South African journalist who defied her
own Government's ban on releasing information to send a report to a London
newspaper.
  The second account was by the Archbishop of Canterbury's peace envoy Terry
Waite, who bravely told of &quot;an evil which must be combatted&quot; - even though
he knew his conversation was being bugged.
  The journalist, who cannot be named, told Mail on Sunday readers of rumors
that the Pretoria Government was planning to hire a criminal to assassinate
black rights leader Bishop Desmond Tutu.
  And she recounted a sickening scene in which a gang of children murdered
a young boy by hacking him with kitchen knives.
  When a mortuary van arrived it could not take the body away - because
it was already full of butchered corpses it had picked up on the way.
  Mr Waite, meanwhile, spoke out in a BBC interview sure to enrage the Botha
regime.
  In a phone call he was aware was being recorded by the authorities, he
attacked South Africa's treatment of its black people as &quot;nothing short
of disgraceful&quot;.
  He added stoutly: &quot;I am perfectly prepared to accept the consequences.&quot;
  Mr Waite, who had earlier been refused permission to visit jailed bishop
Sigismund Ndwandwe, went on: &quot;Absolute power corrupts absolutely, and
at the heart of this system there is an evil which must be combatted.
  &quot;People here are being detained and picked up for absolutely nothing but
doing their job as Christian ministers and Christian bishops.  The world
should know that quite clearly.&quot;
