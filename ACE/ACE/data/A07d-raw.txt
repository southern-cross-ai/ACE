  QUALITY industrial shares yesterday shrugged off the worsening economic
outlook and saved the share market from a sharp fall as they again moved
to record highs.
 The industrial share price index jumped another 10.8 points to reach
a record 2096.7 points, despite the announcement on Tuesday of another
disastrous balance of payments deficit of $1450 million for September
and forecast of a $2 billion deficit for October.
  Comforted by a lack of overseas reaction to the continuing trade deficits,
a phenomenon was evidenced when the Australian dollar rose during the
day to close at US64.4c and just under 45p against sterling.
  The recent boom in*booming Australian share markets has been attributed to 
overseas interest in Australian resource shares as a replacement for the South
African investments now restricted by worldwide sanctions.
  But it is emerging that local investors are propping up the quality
industrial market with continued buying*buyng of the leading stocks.
  Analysts are suggesting that Australian investors are starved of alternative
avenues for placing funds because of the uncertainties in the property
markets and by the tax implications of investing in fixed-interest
securities, with interest payments subject to tax rates up to the impending
universal 50c in the dollar.
  Share dividends appear likely to be tax-free after July 1 next year.
  So, the industrials index has now risen fairly steadily since 
September*Septeber 19, 1985, when it was at 1383, just as Treasurer Paul 
Keating announced his tax &quot;imputation&quot; system that laid the basis for 
tax-free dividends for Australian residents.
  After a trough caused by the initial &quot;banana republic&quot; description of
the economy's future, when the industrial index bottomed at 1742 on July 28,
it has risen 344 points, or just under 20 per cent.
  The strength during the day was aided by special situations and reaction
to various news releases.
  Sharp gains were once more made by:
  - Brambles Industries, which added another 20c to reach a record $7.50,
compared with only $6.30 at the start of October and $4.30 earlier in the
year.
  Brambles has attracted attention because of its surge in overseas operations,
including the skilfully-arranged acquisition of the major railway freight
business in European, CAIB, earlier this year.
 Only 39,000 Brambles shares were traded, indicating an emerging scrip
shortage.
  - Pacific Dunlop also continued to advance, this time with a 10c gain to
$3.80 and a trade in Melbourne of $3.81 during the day.
  - Burns Philp rose only 10c but reached $8 for the first time ever and
looking likely to move up further.
  Only 19,000 Burns Philp shares changed hands during the day and the stock
has moved from $7 to $8 during October with only 581,000 shares involved.
  - Peterville Sleigh completed its recovery after a recent dip caused
by a disappointing profit result by adding 5c to $2.20 after trading as
low as $1.75 last month.
  Only 56,000 Peterville*Petersville shares were traded.
  - The special situation stocks remained quiet, although Woolworths advanced
another 3c to $3.58 and traded as high as $3.65 in Melbourne during the
day.
  Only 37,800 shares were involved on the six exchanges, compared with the
multi-million turnovers earlier in the month when Ron Brierley's Industrial
Equity was establishing an 18 per cent shareholding and raising thoughts
of a raid on the retailer.
  Meanwhile, Coles Myer advanced 10c to $5.50, the best since the speculative
trading earlier in the year caused a freak $6.50 all-time high.
  Only 165,000 shares changed hands with Coles Myer returning a dividend
yield of only 3.8 per cent at the new price.
  Herald and Weekly Times calmed down after a similar move by Industrial
Equity in establishing a 14 per cent shareholding at $6.50 caused the
shares to jump to $7.70 late last week.
  Only 45,000 shares were traded, all at $7.66, just 4c below the all-time
record.
  But it was News Corp that once more led the media section higher.
  News shares rose 70c to 33.20 and traded during the day at a remarkable
all-time high of $33.50 when overseas orders bolstered the market.
  News Corp has now risen from $28.50 at the start of October, from $23
at the start of September and from a low of $9 earlier in the year.
  It trades carrying a 1-for-1 bonus issue.  The 129,000 shares traded
yesterday cost investors, largely overseas, a total of $4.3 million.
  So far this year, 36.78 million News Corp shares have been traded on
Australian share markets at a cost of $674.6 million, whereas last year
only 23.8 million News shares were traded at a cost of only $205 million.
  Bank shares were treated with caution as the US dollar reflected
uncertainty about Third World debts and the effect of any failure on the
US banking structure.
  National rose 4c but was countered with 4c falls by both the ANZ and
Westpac.
