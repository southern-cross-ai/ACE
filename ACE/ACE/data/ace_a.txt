 <h> Gala Opening for extension to Qld Govt's DP centre </h>

  THE Premier of Queensland, Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen, didn't disappoint the 
crowd at the opening of the $20 million extension to the State Government 
Computer Centre in Brisbane last week.
  The Premier, who is facing a State election on November 1, was 
presented  with a tie-pin decorated with a microchip  containing 
more memory than the first computer the centre bought in 1965.  
  Never one to let an opportune moment slip by, Sir Joh reminded guests of 
the awesome power of high technology.
  "Now you know why I'm so afraid of the ID card that our beloved brethren in 
Canberra are so fond of," he said.
  Stages one and two of the State Government Computer Centre are worth $50 
million.  The stage two building cost $20 million and $30 million of computer 
equipment is installed in both sections. 
  The importance of the centre was demonstrated by the calibre of guests at 
the opening ceremony.
  Sir Joh, who officiated, was backed up by the Deputy Premier, Mr Bill Gunn, 
the Minister for Works and Housing, Mr Claude Wharton, the Minister for 
Industry, Small Business and Technology, Mr Mike Ahern, and the Under-
Treasurer, Mr Leo Hielscher.
  With four floors below ground level and two above, the centre is highly 
secure and only certain staff are permitted into "dark areas" where central 
processors are situated.
  Indeed, staff on one level underground have a large television screen 
relaying pictures from a camera focussed on street level to relieve the 
bunker-like*bunker-lie atmosphere and let them know just what sort of a 
day it is outside.
  Alternative power systems have been built-in.  The centre has its own 
electricity sub-station and a diesel system for back-up.
  A computer maintenance system ensures 24-hour operation.
  The director of the State Government Computer Centre, Mr Mal Grierson, said 
the centre now has more than 200 times the processing capacity it had in 1965.
  "As well as supporting individual departmental applications, the centre's 
major responsibilities are the service-wide applications, for example, land 
information systems, government accounting, computer aided drafting, office 
automation and videotex," he said.
  "Research and strategic planning activities play a vital role in the 
centre's activities.
  "Technical developments within the industry are continually monitored and 
researched so as to assist departments to take advantage of current 
innovations.
  "Areas under investigation include resource planning, communications, new 
services such as graphics, electronic mail and videotex, data analysis and 
design support tools."
  According to Mr Gunn, Queensland's computer centre has set a lead for other 
States to follow.
  He had visited other States to assess their facilities and found none to 
match the Queensland venture, he said.

 <h> Japan acts against dumping </h>

<misc> TOKYO:  </misc>

The Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) has started 
surveillance on the export prices of seven popular types of semiconductors in 
a bid to prevent dumping, MITI officials said last week. 
  The items under the strict surveillance, which started on October 1, were 
DRAM, EPROM, SRAM, ECL Logic and RAM, and microprocessors and controllers, 
they said.
  Under the system, Japanese manufacturers have to submit export details on 
each contract.  
  Japan and the United States agreed in August to prevent the dumping of 
Japanese-made semiconductors on the US market.

 <h> PCs take to the congressional campaign trail </h>

<bl> From Jack Bell in New York </bl>

  When the Unites States Congress adjourned last week ahead of the November 4 
election, congressmen from across the country returned to their home 
districts to campaign for re-election.
  These, however, are days different from any other in US politics, thanks to 
the growing use of personal computers by political groups for both 
sophisticated and mundane tasks.
  A Washington DC-based consulting company, Electronic Data Services (EDS), 
for example, uses an IBM PC and specialised mapping software to analyse 
demographic information.
  The office of Wisconsin State senator, Mr Lloyd Kincaid, recently acquired a 
Sperry PC to perform traditional political grunt work - word processing and 
mass mailings.
  During the 1984 presidential campaign, workers for the eventual loser, Mr 
Walter Mondale, were the first to use PCs in a national campaign. 
  "There's no doubt that computers have an application for us," Mr Kincaid's 
administrative aide, Mr Dan Satran, said.
 "We got our equipment from another senator who had lost in the primary, so we 
really didn't have to do any shopping around." 
  On the national level, EDS is using five networked IBM PCs along with the 
Atlas advanced mapping package from Strategic Locations Planning Incorporated 
of San Jose, California, to perform demographic research and consulting for 
the Democratic Party.  
  "We take census information, which includes demographics such as age, race 
and income, and combine it with political information such as voter 
registration and turnout numbers," an EDS research associate, Mr Dale Tibbits, 
said.
   The Atlas program, a general purpose mapping package that constructs maps 
and then displays the corresponding data, is linked to a Hewlett-Packard 
plotter for the production of full-colour maps which display demographic 
information for particular geographic regions.
  For example, if we find that a candidate's support comes from one 
particular precinct, we can tell you what racial and economic groups make up 
that precinct and how you can use this information strategically,"  Mr Tibbits 
said.
  "Because of our ability to combine census and political information, we can 
tell you where you should be concentrating your broadcasting money, where to 
set up campaign headquarters and other strategic decisions."
  In the State of Michigan, the Republican candidate for governor, Mr Dan 
Murphy, used an Apple Macintosh and the business file-vision graphic 
database from Telos Software of Santa Monica, California, to aid*aide financial 
decisions such as media spending and campaign appearances.  
  "Michigan has an especially rigorous campaign financing law," Mr Murphy's 
campaign director, Mr Dick Southern, said.
  "It's very important to target your funds carefully."

 <h> State's programs will stay despite demise of CEP </h>

<bl> HEATHER McKENZIE </bl>

  DESPITE the impending termination of the Commonwealth Computer Education 
Program (CEP) in January, computer education in NSW is alive and well, the 
head of the Computer Education Unit, Dr Ian Pirie, said in Sydney last week.
  Dr Pirie was speaking at the Computer Education Unit's (CEU) software 
suppliers' meeting.
  "The NSW Government has recognised that computer education is a priority 
funding area and subsequently we were untouched in the State Budget," he said.
  Dr Pirie admitted, however, that the CEU had no idea what repercussions the 
program's end would have.
  The unit's staffing arrangements were uncertain, with only five positions 
assured next year, he said.  
  Representatives of software suppliers, the Curriculum Development Centre, the
Catholic Education Office, the State Department of Education, the Federal
Attorney-General's Department, the ACT Schools Authority and the Queensland 
Department of Education attended the meeting.
  Several issues relating to the supply of software for educational purposes 
were discussed.  These included how the unit evaluates software, the proposed 
National Software Coordination Unit (NSCU) and the software industry's view 
of the education market.
  There were also group sessions where the question of copyright and the 
future development of software were addressed.
  "Software is the key to computer education.  Without good software, the 
rest of the equipment is a waste of time," Dr Pirie said.
  "We are here because communication is the key to developing good 
educational software."
  A main problem was that industry was not generally aware of what 
constituted good educational software, he said.
  A lack of communication between education departments and software houses 
had led to the industry not knowing what the education departments required.

  Many software suppliers, however, expressed concern that the lack of 
communication with education departments meant they only knew what was wanted 
after a product was released and found to be wanting.
  It was suggested that software suppliers be given access to evaluation by 
education departments before the final product was released.
  Dr Pirie agreed with the idea, encouraging the suppliers to submit their 
programs for evaluation.
  He said the unit was keen to become involved in this.
  The general opinion among suppliers was that the amount of feedback from the 
Department of Education was not high.  The onus seemed to be on the software 
suppliers to submit their programs for evaluation.
  One of the major tasks of the unit is to advise teachers what constitutes 
good educational software.
  The CEU also has a limited software development committee, called Caresoft, 
which develops specialist educational software.
  "This group meets the needs we don't think industry would take up,"  Dr 
Pirie said.
  A member of the CEU software team, Ms Denise Tolhurst, explained how the 
unit evaluated software.
  The CEU has published 180 software evaluations.  These evaluations are based 
on a form sent to teachers who are chosen primarily through contacts made at 
workshops.  
  One problem with the evaluations is that they are not often tested in the 
field.  Problems of time have so far prevented this, although it is one of the 
unit's long-term objectives.  
 Software is evaluated either by a teacher, a regional consultant or officers 
at the CEU.  They rely on software being submitted by the suppliers for 
evaluation.  If a program is given to the unit, it is kept in the resource 
centre where teachers can access it for themselves. 
  "The purpose of the evaluations is to provide a guide to teachers.  It 
should not be considered as an authoritative*authorative assessment of the 
program," Ms Tolhurst said.
  Some of the software suppliers expressed doubts about the evaluation.  It 
was suggested that some formal group should be established so evaluations 
could take place in a workshop environment, with input from a number of 
teachers, as opposed to individual assessment*assesement.
  Ms Tolhurst said some evaluations were already conducted in workshops, but 
there was no formal scope for such groups at present.  The unit would ideally 
like to conduct evaluations in that way, but the time it took to do so - three 
to four weeks - did not allow it. 
  "The cessation of Commonwealth funding has not made computer education a dead 
issue,"  Dr Pirie said.
  "The whole area of computer education is really moving ahead.  Other 
sections of the NSW Education Department are working on it as well.
  "For example, a building code for computer rooms is being formulated and 
others are looking at creating criteria for qualified computer education 
teachers."

 <h> A fortune has been spent but still more micros are needed </h>

  THE money Australian schools have invested in computers is enough to buy a 
skyscraper, perhaps even a modest tropical island.
  A nationwide study conducted for the Federal Government last year, has 
estimated that at least $57 million has been spent on more than 350,000 
microcomputers by Australian primary and secondary schools.
  But respondents to a survey for the study said the shortage of computers in 
schools and insufficient funds for purchasing more computers were still 
significant drawbacks.
  The survey found that four brands constituted 78 per cent of all machines 
used in the classrooms, with Apple representing 34 per cent, Commodore 19 per 
cent, BBC 12 per cent and Microbee 13 per cent.
  One thousand schools were surveyed for the study called Computer 
Applications in Australian Schools.  It also involved visits to four schools 
in every State by the research team.
  The study led to the discovery of an average of three computers per primary 
school and 14 computers per secondary school, with twice as many machines in 
city schools than country schools.
  A research team member, Professor John Hattie of the University of Western 
Australia, said this was one of the study's most surprising results.
  "The stereotype of a computer locked in a back room with a maths teacher is 
not borne out by the study," he said.  
  He described classroom computing in Australia as in its "early adolescence", 
moving beyond the teething stage of basic introduction towards the development
of a wide range of applications.
  Professor Hattie carried out the study with Professor Don Fitzgerald of the 
University of New England in NSW, and Professor Phil Hughes of the University 
of Tasmania.
  The study found that computers were primarily used for word processing, 
drill and practice, computer awareness courses, simulation and games.

 <h> Lawyer seeks user-pays NCSC, takeover tribunal </h>

<bl> By JOSEPH DOWLING and BEN POTTER </bl>

The National Companies and Securities Commission should be entirely self-
funded and its power to hold hearings in relation to takeovers and market 
practices should be transferred to a takeover tribunal.
  The eminent takeover lawyer, Mr John Green from Freehill Hollingdale and 
Page, made these demands yesterday at a Sydney seminar on takeover 
legislation.
  Mr Green said the concept of "user pays" should apply to the NCSC, and he 
pointed out that the Securities and Exchange Commission in the United States 
and the Ontario Securities Commission were both self-funding.
  He said the NCSC should be freed from the restraints of government 
limitations on salaries and that the commission should be allowed to pay what 
was necessary to retain expert staff.
  "The securities markets and transactions in them move exceedingly quickly.
  "Therefore we need an NCSC that can move as quickly and readily and is able 
to call on outside expert resources if it needs to supplement its own.
  "If we had a system of self-funding, the costs of the system would fall on 
those who use and benefit from it rather than the general taxpayer," he said.
  The NCSC would raise the funds for its operations through charging 
additional fees, either for incorporation of companies, registration of 
takeover bids, lodgment of prospectuses or stock exchange trades.
  He said the current fees for registration of takeover bids were absurdly low 
at $330 for a cash bid and $660 for a non-cash offer.
  "If the fees were, say 0.01 per cent of the final bid price capitalisation 
of the target, (ie. $100 for every $1 million, with a minimum fee of $10,000) 
that should not be a significant deterrent for making bids."
  He suggested a takeover tribunal should be established with a senior 
commercial lawyer or judge as its full-time head and two other members drawn 
from a panel of part-time members with relevant experience.
  "The tribunal would not be bound by the rules of evidence and would have 
powers similar to the subpoena powers of the courts.
  "Importantly, especially given the types of legal actions recently mounted, 
no question of procedure or of fact determination by the tribunal could be 
appealed to any court.                    
  "Under this proposal, what would happen is that where the NCSC was concerned 
about some conduct it would - and it may under its existing powers - 
investigate.
  "It would not and could not hold hearings.
  "Once it formed a view that what had occurred was, for example, 
unacceptable, it would then apply to the tribunal for an appropriate order.
  "The tribunal would hold the hearing, not the NCSC.  The NCSC could not then 
be embarrassed because it also had an incompatible quasi-judicial function," 
he said.
  Also speaking at the conference, the Victorian Attorney-General, Mr Jim 
Kennan, said the NCSC and the Ministerial Council were working with 
international market regulators on proposals for the exchange of securities 
information for enforcing legislation. 
  He told the conference that the regulators were also examining guidelines 
for the acceptance of prospectuses and said these were the first steps in 
international cooperation and would assist Australian investors wanting to 
take advantage of foreign capital markets.
  He said bilateral arrangements between Australia and the US for the 
recognition of prospectuses had been proposed by the US Securities and 
Exchange Commission.
  In addition, Australia would seek to include companies and securities law 
in the multilateral treaty on mutual assistance in criminal matters.
  Negotiations were afoot to link the Sydney Futures Exchange with 
international futures exchanges and for an agreement on the exchange of market 
information in commodities futures trading,  Mr Kennan said.
  And a meeting to be held in London shortly would look at multilateral and 
bilateral treaties on securities regulation, he said.
  "It is envisaged that these treaties will seek to develop ways in which 
market malpractice across international boundaries can be deterred, detected 
and investigated."
  Mr Kennan also called for discussion on raising extra funds from the private 
sector, saying it was not possible to raise the level of State and Federal 
government funding during a period of budgetary restraint.
  Options were to raise fees across the board, levy further fees on 
incorporation and the filing of annual returns (perhaps with a loading for 
listed companies), and further fees on securities licenses.  Registration fees 
could depend on issued or authorised capital, Mr Kennan said.

 <h> Big foreign deal on the cards for Hartogen </h>

<bl> By JOSEPH DOWLING </bl>

  Hartogen Energy Ltd is believed to be on the verge of announcing a 
multi-million dollar deal that may involve an overseas party taking a large 
slice of the company.  
  Market sources said Hartogen had been holding discussions with a number of 
overseas and local groups in recent months, although details have not been 
disclosed.
  They said Hartogen had scheduled a press conference yesterday to announce a 
major corporate development, but one of the parties involved (not Hartogen) 
had asked that the conference be delayed because of its proximity to the 
Queensland State election.
  Hartogen has been the subject of persistent takeover speculation in recent 
months, pushing the share price from $1.65 at August 1, to $2.70 yesterday.
  The speculation has generally linked Hartogen to the French Elf Aquitaine 
Triako group, with some suggestion that Elf Aquitaine may move to sell its
oil exploration interests in Australia to Hartogen.
  Hartogen, in return, would issue shares to Elf Aquitaine*Acquitaine.
  Sources close to the companies yesterday denied that was the case, although 
they confirmed Elf Aquitaine*Acquitaine had been holding discussions with a 
number of Australian companies, including Hartogen. 
  Elf Aquitaine*Acquitaine Australia and New Zealand Ltd, which is 99 per cent
owned by the French parent company, Societe Nationale Elf Aquitaine, earlier 
this year offloaded its 64.5 per cent interest in its mining arm, Elf Aquitaine
Triako Mines Ltd.
  That move was perceived as part of a general move to reduce spending in 
Australia, although the company is believed to be enthusiastic to retain some 
involvement in oil exploration.
  One analyst said last night that any link between Hartogen and Elf 
Aquitaine*Acquitaine may simply involve a merging of exploration leases.
  Hartogen is believed to be close to completing plans for the listing of its 
shares on the Tokyo market, although company directors were not available 
yesterday to comment on any of the speculation.
  Likewise, Elf Aquitaine directors would not comment.

 <h> Lumley accounts declared invalid </h>

<bl> By HEATHER KILLEN </bl>

  Edward Lumley Ltd's 1986 accounts, directors' report and notice of meeting 
were declared invalid yesterday by Mr Justice Needham in orders handed down in 
the NSW Supreme Court.
  The orders followed the judgment handed down on Monday concerning a dispute 
between Lumley and BT Insurance Ltd, controlled by Mr Brent Potts and Mr Brian 
Yuill, over seats on the Lumley board.
  BT Insurance, a 23 per cent shareholder in Lumley, has nominated two 
candidates for election to the board at the company's forthcoming annual 
general meeting.
  However, Lumley directors stated in a circular to shareholders that only 
three directors could be elected, and the Lumley family, 55 per cent 
shareholders, had thrown its weight behind the incumbents.
  On Monday, Mr Justice Needham ruled that four directors could be elected to 
the Lumley board because of a technical breach which occurred in 1982.
  In accordance with the company's articles of association, Mr Anthony 
Crichton-Brown should have been re-elected as a director when he resigned as 
an executive director and assumed the role of managing director in 1982.
  However, the election did not take place and a vacancy on the board has 
existed since that time.
  Mr Justice Needham said yesterday that the company's notice of meeting, 
directors' report and accounts contained irregularities which may cause 
substantial injustice that could not be remedied by order of the court.
  He ordered Lumley to inform shareholders as soon as possible that the annual 
general meeting would not take place on November 5 as scheduled, and that new 
notice of meeting, accounts and reports would be sent out in due course.
  He also ordered the company to issue new notice, accounts and reports, and 
point out to shareholders the changes made to these documents.
  Further, the company must send out new proxy forms and is restrained from 
counting any previous proxies.
  Lumley was also ordered to pay all costs incurred by the action.
  Justice Needham said BT Insurance's nominations to the Lumley board were 
still valid, as was the special resolution the company will put to the Lumley 
meeting to change the terms of the employee share scheme.

 <h> Aust brokers have big hopes for New York </h>

<bl> From MALCOLM MAIDEN in New York </bl>

  Several Australian broking houses in New York are expanding their operations 
significantly.
  The brokers are concentrating on developing bond dealing capacity in 
recognition of the emergence of a major US market for Australian bonds in 
the past year.
  But, the expansion also covers equity operations and demonstrates confidence 
on the part of the brokers about future US investor demand for Australian
paper.
  Bain and Co, J.B. Were and A.C. Goode are all chancing their arms against the 
bond trading might of the US investment houses which developed the Australian 
bond market in New York.
  Bain and Were are also expanding their equity dealing capacity, and the 
overdue entry of Melbourne's McCaughan Dyson is expected early in 1987.
  Goode's top New York man Mr Hugh Webb Ware said the developments reflected 
the fact that "the US will be a major force in the Australian bond market for 
the foreseeable future".
  US investor interest in the Australian bond market surged during the final 
quarter of 1985.  The attitude of US investors towards Australian economic 
developments since then has had an important influence on the development of 
policy responses to the economic crisis.
  The initial wave of widely based US buying of Australian bonds, either 
directly or through retail vehicles such as the First Australia Prime Income 
Fund, was triggered by a wide yield spread between Australian and US 
government securities, and the belief that the $A was stable at about US70c.
  Today, the interest rate spread remains, but many US investors have been 
burned by the subsequent slide in the $A, now partially reversed.
  The drop in the dollar's value did not rout the US market, however, and 
Australian brokers claim that in the long term, US investors may prove more 
stable than Japanese houses.
  It is argued that the bond and equity investment is being led by 
institutions establishing core holdings offshore as part of the 
internationalisation of their portfolios.
  Bain's New York office is in the process of more than doubling its floor 
space as part of a major upgrade.  Bain currently fields two brokers in New 
York, two corporate advice executives and four support staff.
  In coming months, the broker will introduce a bond trader, two new equities 
dealers, one more corporate advice executive and additional support 
personnel.
  Bain has traditionally been a major player in the $A bond market but until 
now, the New York office has serviced US demand for Australian bonds in 
concert with its London office.  A similar system is employed by Westpac-Ord 
Minnett.
  Bain's London partner in charge of bonds Mr Graham Morton, will oversee the 
establishment of the New York bond dealing operation later this year and ease 
the first New York bond dealer, Mr Hal Heron, into the job.
  Were will boost its broking staff from three to five and establish a bond 
trading operation to be run by Mr John Clark, ex-London.
  The existing equities operation will be boosted by the addition of Mr Sam 
Brougham, currently trading in Melbourne, Mr Peter Wade and Mr Tom Hayward.
  Mr Wade worked for Were in New York from 1981 to 1984 then returned to the 
Melbourne office to manage Far Eastern activities.  He will be an 
institutional dealer in New York, while Mr Hayward will be an equity 
salesman.
  Goode has already set up a bond trading operation by bringing Mr Tom 
Larkworthy from Melbourne.
  Said Mr Jim Rayner of Were: "We are a separate profit centre here, and
the expansion makes a statement about expected profitability."

 <h> BIG BROTHER IS GETTING BIGGER </h>

TRADITIONAL Australian qualities of individuality, non-conformity 
and self-reliance have been severely eroded in a year, according 
to a leading civil liberties group.
  It has laid the blame for stifling much of the country's 
development at the door of governments and their "big 
brother" urge to control people's lives.
  Australian Civil Liberties Union president John Bennett  said 
recent calls to introduce identity cards and to use telephone 
taps were the latest assaults on privacy.
  The Federal Government wants to introduce the identity card to control
tax evasion, illegal immigration and security fraud.
 There have been calls to legalise telephone tapping to combat organised
crime and drug dealing.
  "Individually, the extensions of Federal and State government powers
are often understandable and to some extent justifiable," said Mr Bennett,
who is also a lawyer.
  "But the overall effect is to make us a more tightly controlled society
with often unnecessary surveillance."
  The Civil Liberties Union cited several areas where people's rights had
been intruded upon in recent years, particularly under the present Federal
Government:   
  Attempted introduction of a national identity card;
  Planned phone-tapping and the examination of mail to combat drug offences;
  Introduction of random breath testing;
  Proposed Bill of Rights and Human Rights Commission;
  Questioning of the jury system;
  Assets test on pensions;
  Using investigators - in some cases with more power than police - in the
Medicare system;
  Photographs on some drivers' licences and train tickets.
  Mr Bennett accused governments, and the bureaucracy, of manipulating
emotional issues to gain public support for increased surveillance 
measures.         
  "People read about the tragic effects of drugs and they give the OK for
phone-tapping and identity cards without considering threats to civil
liberties," he said.
  "These measures had little effect in the U.S.
  "The danger of ID cards is they can be used to monitor the activities
of citizens.
  "The cards must be produced on demand of the government which makes them
almost an internal passport."

  The shaven-headed chanters say they will take as many of the unemployed
as the CES can supply and will send them out to beautify Sydney.
  "Work is very instructive to the soul and is essential if these kids

 <h> THE NIGHTMARE WE SAW </h>

TWO champions of freedom have risked arrest by speaking out about the horrors
they have witnessed in South Africa.
  One chilling report came from a South African journalist who defied her
own Government's ban on releasing information to send a report to a London
newspaper.
  The second account was by the Archbishop of Canterbury's peace envoy Terry
Waite, who bravely told of "an evil which must be combatted" - even though
he knew his conversation was being bugged.
  The journalist, who cannot be named, told Mail on Sunday readers of rumors
that the Pretoria Government was planning to hire a criminal to assassinate
black rights leader Bishop Desmond Tutu.
  And she recounted a sickening scene in which a gang of children murdered
a young boy by hacking him with kitchen knives.
  When a mortuary van arrived it could not take the body away - because
it was already full of butchered corpses it had picked up on the way.
  Mr Waite, meanwhile, spoke out in a BBC interview sure to enrage the Botha
regime.
  In a phone call he was aware was being recorded by the authorities, he
attacked South Africa's treatment of its black people as "nothing short
of disgraceful".
  He added stoutly: "I am perfectly prepared to accept the consequences."
  Mr Waite, who had earlier been refused permission to visit jailed bishop
Sigismund Ndwandwe, went on: "Absolute power corrupts absolutely, and
at the heart of this system there is an evil which must be combatted.
  "People here are being detained and picked up for absolutely nothing but
doing their job as Christian ministers and Christian bishops.  The world
should know that quite clearly."

 <h> TAX REWARD FOR SUPER PEACE </h>

<h> Cuts `carrot' to make unionists toe Federal line </h>

<bl> From PETER GIBSON, Political Reporter, in Canberra </bl>

TAX cuts will be dangled before angry trade unions as a Federal Government
carrot to take the heat out of the superannuation war.
  Workers' leaders will be offered a $9 a week reduction in income tax
from September 1 in return for taking a softer approach.
  Government sources confirmed today that senior ministers believe it
essential to give militant unionists the extra incentive as soon as possible.
  The cuts would also probably strengthen the Government's argument for
a further discounting of the next national pay case, due early in 1987.
  So far Prime Minister Bob Hawke has given a commitment only to make the
cuts before the end of this year.
  But Cabinet, under enormous pressure to stop a breakout by big unions
from the ordered wage-fixing system, will be forced to decide the timing
of the cuts by early July.
  The first shot in the union struggle for wholesale national superannuation
- the issue rejected in yesterday's Arbitration Commission ruling - will
be fired next Monday.
  That is the day the ACTU wages campaign committee meets to plot tactics
for the next six months.
  Key unions in the building, transport, oil, maritime and metal industries
will make it clear that they intend to push for superannuation benefits
quickly.                        
  Smaller, weaker unions which do not have the muscle-power of the "big
boy" industries could wait up to two years to win the same benefits.
  ACTU president Simon Crean is heralding the superannuation battle as the
key to the future of the crucial Prices and Incomes Accord.
  He warned that if employers are not willing to negotiate schemes with
their workers, the Accord will crumble.
  And Tom McDonald, secretary of the Building Workers Industrial Union,
said employers must agree to the superannuation in the light of this year's
solitary pay rise of 2.3 per cent.
  And Metal Workers Union boss Greg Harrison today predicted widespread
industrial action over the next six months.
  Initial indications from employers were that action would be necessary
to win superannuation benefits, he said.
  Mr Harrison said the metals, transport, building and stevedoring industries
would be affected.                                         
  But Mr Hawke doesn't agree.
   He said today he was confident there would not be industrial trouble
over superannuation.
  The decision to allow individual negotiations for superannuation on an
industry-by-industry basis was excellent, he said.
 Yesterday's decision by the Arbitration Commission effectively said "no"
to ordering employers to pay into superannuation schemes.
  It ruled that bosses must genuinely agree to voluntary schemes, and it
also put a 3 per cent ceiling on contributions.
  The Commission is to call a conference of unions, employers and governments
to draw up guidelines for negotiating.

 <h> CHIPP TO QUIT ON SUNDAY </h>

<bl> From PETER GIBSON in Canberra </bl>

DEMOCRATS leader Don Chipp is set to quit politics this weekend.
  Mr Chipp plans to announce his retirement, which has been expected for
some months, on Sunday.
  A bitter struggle between deputy leader Senator Janine Haines and Victorian
Senator John Siddons is expected.
  Senator Haines is expected to win the fight which will split the party.
  The victory will make her the first woman leader of a parliamentary party
in Australia.
  Senator Chipp has been in Parliament for 25 years, spending the last nine
as leader of the Democrats.
  He quit the Liberal party after being passed over for a place in the

 <h> Apartheid and the Ella brothers </h>

POLITICS and sport clashed head on today when the 47 members of the Australian
Rugby Union met in a `closed to the press' discussion.
  As the Aussie dollar tumbled on world-wide money markets, Australian unions
baulked at superannuation and taxation deals and the Prime Minister, Mr
Hawke, urged the nation to buy and think Australian, the Australian Rugby
Union were asked to consider accepting an invitation for an official team
to tour South Africa, centre of world attention.
  The nation of P.W. Botha, Prime Minister of a country where apartheid
rules the roost and white has might; where some 3000 have been locked up
without trial since a state of emergency was declared almost a month ago
and 1500 - mostly black - have perished since Christmas.
  A nation which is under the threat of economic sanctions from the West
- and a nation of some 5 million whites which can lay claim to being Rugby
Union's world champions, despite two decades of international `exile' from
the amateur game.
 Somehow, the Springboks, South Africa's national Rugby team, has survived,
despite the world's condemnation*condemmation of the Johannesburg Government 
and its black and white policies.
  "They are the team to beat," said Mark Ella, the only man to notch tries
against each of the Home Countries on the first grand slam Wallaby tour
- who wouldn't go when asked to play in the Durban Sevens.
  His twin brother, Glen, Randwick and Australian fullback, did - but younger
brother, Gary, now an officer with the Aboriginal Affairs Department and
working out of Bourke, wouldn't have a bar of it.
  The tremendous trio spent hours discussing the various invitations to
Botha land.
  In just the one family, albeit Australian Rugby Union's finest family
since the Thornett brothers, dissension was rife.
  And the cause of the blue was South Africa, football and politics.
  Mark, former Australian captain, was offered money to play with a "Rest
of the World XV" when the Springboks were desperate to flex their Rugby
Union muscles.
  It would have been a deal similar to the one offered to the Australian
rebel cricketers who lost to Graeme Pollock's team last summer.
   Glen, along with David Campese and Roger Gould, played in the Durban
Sevens.  They weren't paid.
  But nagging away at the minds of all those sportsmen was the question:
Are we doing the right thing?
  Mark Ella, pin-up for more kids than you can poke a stick at, well knows
his responsibilities.
  He also respects the right of the individual.
  Said Mark, who was told he would be `an honorary white' if he had accepted 
the South African offer: "As an individual, I wouldn't go to South Africa,
honorary white or not.
  "If the ARU (Australian Rugby Union) today decides to accept the invitation
to tour, and I was selected, I would tour.
  "I wouldn't want to let my country down.  A player, I feel, has to put
his country first and it's an honor to be chosen to play for your country.
  "It's also a tremendous feeling to be recognised as one of the world's
best.
  "Had an official Australian team been going to South Africa when I was
playing - and if I'd been selected - I'd have been proud to go.
  "And I'd have stayed in the same hotel as Alan Jones and the rest of the
team.
  "As an individual, I refused to go.  As an aboriginal, I can't condone
the South African Government's policies.
  "I feel that, if I went as Mark Ella, person, not Mark Ella, member of
the Australian team, I would have been doing so (condoning Botha's bullies).
  "Glen had the right to go, but I don't think he'll go again, team or
individual.  Everybody has the right to go - I chose not to.
  "At the same time, putting on my rugby hat, the Springboks are the team
to beat.
  "They've just beaten the New Zealand Cavaliers and no country can really
lay claim to being world champions unless they've beaten the 'Boks.
  "It's a crying shame they aren't allowed to play - every Rugby player
wants to play in or against South Africa.
  "It's the biggest challenge in rugby, that's why they'll keep offering
tours and rugby countries will keep accepting them."
  While the 47-man ARU will meet today at Rushcutters Bay to discuss the
South African invitation - and its repercussions on Brisbane's tilt for
the 1992 Olympics and Australia's standing in the sporting community at
large - only 12 actually get to vote on the issue.

 <h> FACING UP TO SPRING </h>

<bl> By Fashion Editor KERRY YATES </bl>

There's an important fashion message to be read into every label in the new 
spring ranges from the leading French cosmetic houses.
  Bourjois has given the `green light' to exciting brights with its Feu Vert 
collection and Harriet Hubbard Ayer invites you on a Weekend Exotique.
  Christian Dior takes a retro trip to the colonies with Les Coloniales and 
Yves Saint Laurent's Fatale imparts a warning that it's fatal NOT to try the 
mysterious colors inspired by the heroines of Alfred Hitchcock movies.
  The fantasies involved in planning the new spring faces are fascinating.  
  Once the companies decide on their inspiration for the season, they go 
head-over-heels to name all their products along that particular theme. 
  All very theatrical, and that's how you'll feel with the dramatic color 
changes we'll be facing up to this spring.
  All the top makeup companies have one certain message: spring faces will 
be bold, bright and beautiful.  
  Top fashion colors like tangerine, violet, turquoise, shocking pink, and 
brilliant blue, also go to the eyes.
  All the cosmetic houses have those strong shades in eyeshadows, with matching 
eye-pencils and mascaras.  How you mix the shades is up to you but always 
apply a pale shadow like white, beige, pale pink over the eyelid right up
to the eyebrow first, making a base to take the next color.
  Matt faces are given a warm tint with a dusting of beige or pink tonings, 
blended to almost nothing.
  Lips are outlined with pencil and smudged to form a base for the lipstick. 
Lipsticks are shimmering, almost invisible lip glosses or soft, creamy 
shades for day, and wild-as-you-dare after dark.  Do try some of the frosted 
multi-colored lipsticks by Lancome which combine unusual colors like orange 
and irridescent violet for a rainbow effect.
  CHRISTIAN DIOR was inspired by movies like Out of Africa and Somerset 
Maugham novels in creating its soft, reflective Les Coloniales range.  A rose 
lipstick named Colonial, a blue-rose shade Hammock and a lip shimmer called 
Parasol bring to mind delicate English ladies in the colonies.  Eyes are 
bright, cheeks soft, lashes lacquered, lips fresh and cool with irridescent 
shades like Sunshine and Subdued Light.
  ESTEE LAUDER is bold modern and rah-rah-rah with Boating Party Colors.  
Inspired by happy picnics on the lake and a countryside splashed with color, 
the eyeshadow sets include colors like Picnic Wine, Sunrise Peach, Radiant 
Teal and lipsticks in Bright Day Red, Sunripe Melon and Sunrise Beige.  A new 
addition is a Natural Blush Coloring Creme, which helps you to apply color 
lightly and evenly with a sponge.
  HARRIET HUBBARD AYER's Weekend Exotique range promises your face an exotic 
color romp.  Smudge the eyes in intense color using two pearly shades like 
Rose Intense and Campanule (a fresh bright blue), outline the total eye in 
bright blue kajal and apply a dazzling blue mascara. Also exciting is Luminous 
Yellow eyeshade.  Lips bloom with fashion shades of Mandarine, Magnolia 
(brilliant rose) and Hibiscus, a summer red.
  YVES SAINT LAURENT's adventurous Fatale collection is inspired by classical 
beauties like Grace Kelly and Eva Marie Saint, heroines of Alfred Hitchcock 
movies.  Eyes are widened with a daring pink shadow high on the arc and a hint 
of green shading on the lid.  Lashes are smothered in shocking pink mascara 
tipped with turquoise for a starry look.  Sensuous lips are created with 
coral red lipstick.
  Bourjois has signalled the go ahead to light up your face with a range of 
pert, extra bright colors.  Eyes are wild by mixing Feu Vert, bold, fresh 
green - applied directly along the eyelashes and drawn out and up towards the 
eyebrows - with Rose Printemps, a lively intense pink lightening up the arch 
and lid of the eye.  Lashes are brushed thickly with emerald green mascara 
called Emeraude.  Bright, light lips are dressed up with shimmering orange 
(Rebecca) and pink (Cosima).

 <h> Share bargains galore at monthly auctions </h>

<bl> By DAN BROOKS </bl>

Unwanted shares end up at garage sales, too.
  Partly-paid shares - forfeited by investors who fail to meet instalment 
payments - are auctioned after trading has finished at the stock exchange.
  Usually, one auction is held each month.
  It offers companies the chance to finish raising the extra capital they 
sought when making calls on their contributing shares.
 Last week, geologist-unit trust manager Graeme Foley swapped the office for 
the auction room to rap the gavel on 85,000 BA Petroleum Explorers Trust 
(BAPET) units.
  Mr Foley, manager of BA Oil and Gas Management, knocked down the lot for 
$22,100.
  The bidders paid 26c - 9c above the reserve price.
  The 17c reserve equalled the size of the call on the units. Defaulting 
shareholders can expect to recoup the difference above the reserve price.
  Why do bidders bother buying other people's discards?  Like any auction, 
they have an eye on the bargain.
  This wasn't so at the BAPET sale where the price paid was the same as the 
ordinary sharemarket value.
  Stock exchange officials say 95 per cent of forfeited share auctions involve 
mining companies, usually No Liability companies, with unpaid calls.
  Occasionally, an industrial company with partly-paid shares holds a sale.
  Investors in danger of having their shares confiscated and sold from under 
them are given six weeks' grace to pay up.
  In BAPET's case, call money was overdue on 241,000 units in the fortnight 
leading to the auction.
  Tardy payments by some investors reduced the number of shares to finally go 
under the hammer to 85,000.
  A licensed auctioneer is hired for most occasions.
  The rules specify the company gives 10 days' notice of a proposed sale to its 
home exchange.

 <h> MOMENT OF TRUTH FOR INVESTORS </h>

Australia's sharemarket boom faced a test today after a falling off in 
international support and a lower gold price during the weekend.
  However, situation stocks - including Woolworths, Herald and Weekly Times, 
ACI and Email - looked likely to keep the action bubbling along.
  Woolworths will be in the spotlight after rising 8c on Friday on lively 
turnover, and subsequently sustaining its higher level of $3.40 in London 
trading.
  The big retailer, crippled by heavy losses from its Big W stores, could 
soon be up for grabs the 19.9 per cent held by Safeways of the US ends up 
in unfriendly hands.
  Safeways is inviting sealed tenders for the parcel, although Woolies has the 
right to nominate a friendly buyer if it can find one prepared to match the 
winning offer.
  By contrast, Coles Myer eased to $4.83 in London to wipe out most of 
Friday's gain.
  Overall, Australian industrial shares were virtually untested in London 
although most prices held firm.
  One stock continuing to attract international investors was News 
Corporation at a record $29.10 in late London trading following a 60c jump 
to $29 in Sydney.
  Banks attracted light demand from U.S. bargain hunting.
  Westpac closed at $4.55, ANZ at $5.20 and National Australia at $5.28.
  Hooker continued to firm, closing at $2.40, but Lend Lease eased to $8.45.
  A leading London broker reported that early strength in the bullion price 
encouraged initial UK and European buying of selected gold shares and leading 
miners.
  WMC was a little firmer at $4.42 with GMK higher at $14.30, while associate 
Central Norseman was steady at $15.30.
  Kidston at $8 was steady on Sydney's lower price, but Placer Pacific looked 
firmer at $2.80.

 <h> Visiting broker likes sound of his own fund </h>

<bl> By Dan Brooks </bl>

SOUTH African born Martin Simpson is a New York stockbroker channeling 
Australian investors' money into international high-technology stocks.
  It calls for rapid decisions from the investment guru who has a machine-gun 
like patter to match.
  He was in Sydney last week extolling the locally-managed fund that bears his 
name, The Martin Simpson High Technology Fund.
  Offering a quick apology - he had only 13 minutes to spare for a hotel 
lobby interview before darting to a North Sydney business meeting - he 
delivered what has come to be a condemnation of our high-tech hopefuls.
  "Many of the smaller companies here in the high-tech field are new ideas and 
blue sky and bit of this and a bit of that," he said.
  "We are cautious on the Australian high technology field because many of the 
companies are less seasoned (than their over-seas counterparts).
  "They're more venture capital than high-tech."
  But Mr Simpson's attitude seems to have softened since a visit last 
February.
  The fund did not have a cent in the local market then.
  He was reported as saying some were "accidents waiting to happen."
  Since then, the fund has added five home-grown companies to its global 
portfolio of technology and health care stocks: Sarich Technologies, Icom, 
Memtec, Idaps and Peptide.
  "We bought, in spite of my protestations to the contrary, a few shares (3000, 
it ensues) in Sarich at about $8.60," he said this week.
  "They're now $20 and, knock on wood, seem to be heading in the right 
direction."
  Even so, Australian stocks accounts for a mere 1.3 per cent of the fund's 
overall value.
  The unlisted fund is managed by ABC Fund Managers, part of Melbourne 
businessman, Joseph Gutnick's First Investors Securities Ltd.
  Funds raised have doubled to $13.5 million over the past six months and the 
portfolio's capital growth has tipped 36 per cent.
  Reasons for setting up a local fund bearing his name are simple.  He has a 
sister living in Australia. 
  He intends launching the fund in New Zealand on this visit.
  Born in Capetown, Mr Simpson went to Michaelhouse school, Natal, where one of 
his school chums was Robert Holmes a Court.
  They next met when Mr Simpson came to Perth during a two-year honeymoon in 
the early 60s.
  "Robert was then driving a taxi to pay his way through the University of 
West Australia.
  "The last time we spoke, he was thinking in billions."
  Mr Simpson settled in New York in 1965 and eight years later formed the 
Martin Simpson &amp; Co Inc stockbroking firm specialising in monitoring 
technology enterprises.
  He said:  "For us, high-tech means well established companies with good 
growth prospects and very strong managements.
  "We are very, very selective.
  "Most of the equities we invest in will continue to be European, Japanese 
or American although we certainly have a place for Australian stocks to 
participate."
  Good decisions were vital because world high-tech stocks have been generally 
depressed over the past three years.
  Many stocks sell at 20c in the dollar.
  They won't all go back to a dollar but a number will, he said.

 <h> Evans moves for steady oil prices </h>

AUSTRALIAN Energy Minister Gareth Evans has thrown his support behind stable 
world oil prices.
  Mr Evans is visiting Gulf oil nations ahead of the Organisation of Petroleum 
Exporting Countries' October 6 meeting in Geneva.
  He discussed prices with Kuwait Oil Minister Sheikh Ali al-Khalifa al-Sabah 
yesterday and, according to official sources, expressed Australia's 
willingness to maintain price stability.
  Mr Evans was due later to fly to Saudi Arabia before visiting Oman on a 
four-nation tour.
  His talks came on top of forecasts by Iranian Oil Minister Gholamreza 
Aqazadeh that OPEC will work for a $US19 a barrel oil price by year-end.
  The Iranian minister was speaking in Jeddah where he met Saudi Arabia's Oil 
Minister Ahmed Zaki Yamani.
  Together, they discussed prices and production quotas for OPEC's 13 member 
states.
  Before leaving Iran, Aqazadeh said he would possibly discuss regional 
issues with Saudi and Kuwaiti heads of state - a reference to the six-year-old 
Iran-Iraq war.
  He called the meeting with Sheikh Yamani "brotherly and friendly."

 <h> World finance talks begin </h>

FINANCIAL leaders from 151 nations met today to discuss ways to resolve the 
conflict between the need to boost a stubbornly sluggish world economy and 
their own political and economic priorities.
  The meetings of the interim committee of the International Monetary Fund 
and World Bank will set the agenda for the joint IMF-World Bank annual 
conference, which formally opens on Wednesday, Sydney time.
  Over the weekend, the United States apparently failed to win promises from 
West Germany, Japan and other industrial countries to stimulate their 
economies beyond the exchange rate changes they have been promoting.
  US Treasury Secretary James Baker and his visiting counterparts declined to 
comment on the weekend meetings outside a formal statement.

 <h> BAMBOO EXCHANGE OPENS FOR BUSINESS </h>

CHINESE citizens are now able to buy and sell shared issues by two Shanghai 
companies in the country's first stock market since the 1949 communist 
takeover.
  The official Xinhua news agency said more than $US21,000 worth of shares 
changed hands when the limited market opened on Friday in Shanghai.
  "Shareholders will trade their stocks freely on the market according to the 
prices quoted and pay a certain amount of commission after transactions are 
concluded," Xinhua said.
  Trading will be restricted to shares issued by the Shanghai Acoustics 
Equipment Producing Company and the Yanzhong Industrial Company Ltd.  The 
former has issued 500,000 yuan ($US135,100) and the latter, five million yuan 
($US1.35 million) in 50 yuan stocks.
  Many Chinese enterprises sell shares to their employees, but this will be 
the first time that stocks will be traded freely.
  LI Xiangrui, president of the Shanghai branch of the People's Bank of China, 
said, however, that conditions are not yet ripe for long-term fund markets or 
a general stock exchange.
  "The limited stock trading may serve as a trial balloon, which will 
stimulate enterprises to institute the stock system and pave the way for 
establishing a stock exchange in the city," LI said.
  As part of its financial reforms, the government freed Chinese enterprises 
to issue and sell stocks and bonds two years ago.
  The policy was designed to encourage firms to use such sales to raise 
capital, thereby reducing the financial drain on state coffers and 
encouraging the use of personal savings.
  Shanghai is China's leading industrial and commercial area and was the 
main financial center until the 1949 communist revolution.
  After the takeover, the city's financial markets were closed and until 
recent years stock exchanges were vilified as capitalist institutions.
  The country's first experimental bond market opened last month in the 
northeastern city of Shenyang.
  Shenyang was also selected for China's first bankruptcy, which was 
declared in August.
  Xinhua said assets of the firm, the Shenyang Explosion Proof Equipment 
Factory, were sold off last week in the country's first ever property 
auction.
  The factory was bought as an entity by the engineering section of the 
Shenyang Gas Supply Co for 200,000 yuan ($US54,000).
  Chinese economists are alarmed at the number of state-run enterprises 
running at a loss, but efforts to formulate a nationwide bankruptcy law have 
been delayed, apparently because of fears of widespread layoffs.

<h> WALL ST TRADING AT ONE-MONTH LOW </h>

WALL Street suffered its slowest trading day in a month on Friday, although 
the index managed to end the session in the plus column.
  By the close of trade the Dow Jones industrial average, which fell 34.73 
points on Thursday, was up 1.13 points at 1769.69.
  Big Board volume amounted to 115.27 million shares compared with 134.29 
million on Thursday.
  It is the lowest level since August 25 when 104.35 million shares changed 
hands.  Traders said the stockmarket suffered from early weakness in the 
bond market but was able to bounce back.  Takeover activity continues to 
draw much of the spotlight, they said.
  Janney Montogomery Scott, vice-president in equity trading of Sidney Dorr 
said trading was "fairly sloppy" as money managers "window dressed" their 
portfolios before the end of the third quarter.
  Oppenheimer and Co market analyst Charles Comer said the market remained 
trendless and polarised.
  Standard and Poor's 500-stock index edged up 0.02 points to 232.23; the New 
York Stock Exchange composite index rose 0.45 points to 133.94.
  Prices ended narrowly higher in moderate trading on the American Stock 
Exchange.  The index rose 2.86 points to 261.98.
London
  SHARE prices closed on the bottom on Friday with sentiment at its lowest 
ebb.

 <h> Drug pair `will still be hanged'  </h>

  ONLY hours after the Malaysian Government had granted convicted drug 
runners Brian Chambers and Kevin Barlow a two-week stay of execution, 
Penang's top legal authority said the two men would still be hanged. 
  Penang's senior legal advisor Mr Shaari Yussof said last night he 
expected the two Australians would be executed, regardless of the
complex legal manoeuvres employed in a bid to save them. 
  Mr Shaari said the facts of the case remained that Malaysian courts had 
passed sentence and the Pardons Board had rejected pleas for clemency. 
  "A reprieve has not been granted and it is clear they will hang," 
Mr Shaari said.  "Under the due process of law the executions will be 
carried out." 
  Chambers' mother Mrs Sue Chambers said last night news of the stay of 
execution was "like the sun coming out". 
  "I've been holding my breath for so long about this.  It's nice to be able 
to get some oxygen," she said. 
  The mothers of both the men were visiting their sons in Pudu Jail 
yesterday morning when an Australian High Commission official told them
of the stay of execution. 
  "We all just stood there and grinned at one another," Mrs Chambers said. 
  "It is the only little bit of good news we have had since we have been 
here.  I suppose anything was an improvement on what the
position was before." 
  The Malaysian Government gave an assurance in the Penang
High Court yesterday that warrants for the execution of Chambers, 29, and
Barlow, 28, would not be issued while legal proceedings were under way to save
their lives. 
  Justice Edgar Joseph Jnr has fixed a hearing for July 4 when he
will further consider the arguments of Chambers' lawyer Mr Subash Shandran.
  Mr Shandran is arguing for an extended stay of execution pending a plea for
the Malaysian Supreme Court to re-hear Chambers' appeal, which the court
rejected last December. 
  Mr Subash Shandran is claiming an important trial procedure relied on by 
the trial judge is no longer applicable in Malaysia. 
  He is arguing that since 1981 the Supreme Court, in applying a Privy Council
decision on a Singapore case, had ruled the judge should hear both prosecution
and defence before a decision. 
  It was under these rules that Barlow and Chambers were tried.  But in 
March this year, three months after the rejection of the appeals, the 
Supreme Court said it was wrong in applying the Singapore
case. 
  Mr Subash Shandran also told the Judge the lawyers for the two
condemned men had not been officially told of the Pardons Board's rejection
of their clemency petitions and had only learned of them through press reports.
  Barlow and Chambers were sentenced to death in July last year.

 <h> Fears over 100-year-old rail bridge </h>

<h> Engineers warn of big crack </h>

<bl> By Peter Grimshaw and Tracey Arthur </bl>

  GRAVE fears were raised yesterday about the safety of a railway
bridge used every day by thousands of commuters travelling to and from the Blue
Mountains. 
  A civil engineer who inspected the bridge yesterday said it needed
urgent repairs otherwise it could "fail". 
  If that happened, a train could slide off the bridge and fall 30m into 
a canyon below. 
  A State Rail Authority spokesman said last night that repairs were under 
way at the viaduct over Knapsack Gully at Lapstone at the foot of the Blue 
Mountains. 
  He said trains were operating at a reduced speed over the bridge while 
maintenance work was completed. 
  "There is no danger to the public, otherwise we would not be running
trains," he said. 
  "This viaduct is over 100 years old and all the old bridges
and viaducts require repairs from time to time." 
  But the Opposition transport spokesman, Mr Bruce Baird, and the 
Liberal spokeswoman for the Blue Mountains, Mrs Margaret Bradshaw, said 
yesterday they feared the bridge was a safety hazard. 
  Mr Baird and Mrs Bradshaw visited the site yesterday with the civil
engineer and said there was a huge crack along the structure and many bricks
had fallen out. 
  "The technical experts say that unless something is done about
it, we could face a serious problem in the next six months," Mr Baird said.
  "Remember, this is the only rail access route to the Blue Mountains and there
is the question of all those passengers who use it every day to consider." 
  The civil engineer who inspected the bridge with Mr Baird said it was never
designed to take the heavy traffic and coal loads it carries today. 
  "If any heavy loads come down the hill and on to the bridge with any 
velocity, the bridge could fail," he said. 
  The engineer, who declined to be named for professional reasons, said the 
crack along the structure was big enough to put an adult's hand into. 
  He said that the top section of the bridge had moved several centimetres 
away from its normal position. 
  "Say you had two or three locomotives loaded with coal using the bridge at 
any great speed then the whole thing could move sideways," he said. 
  "If something is not done in the next six months the bridge could be 
enormously dangerous." 
  Mrs Bradshaw said: "There is no cause for immediate alarm but the bridge 
needs urgent work."

 <h> Casino pledge by Unsworth </h>

  ORGANISED crime will not be allowed to infiltrate Sydney's legal casino, 
the incoming Premier, Mr Unsworth, pledged yesterday. 
  Mr Unsworth said it was imperative the Government take steps to
ensure there was no scope for criminal elements to intrude into its operations.
  He said his Government would take every step needed. 
  Only a few years ago, Mr Unsworth was quoted as saying he didn't like 
casinos because they were a cover up for organised crime. 
  He said at the time he thought casinos would provide a
method of tax avoidance and lead to the corruption of casino officials and
operators. 
  But Mr Unsworth said yesterday circumstances had changed since he
made those statements. 
  He said he now believed a legal casino at Darling Harbour would help 
eliminate the illegal activity that sprang up during the term of the 
Askin Government.

 <h> Bird racket crackdown coming </h>

<bl> By Bill Watt </bl>

  NEW measures to restrict illegal trapping of wild birds are being 
considered by the State Government. 
  This follows a National Parks and Wildlife Service survey which
discovered many more birds had been sold in retail outlets than had been bred
in captivity.  
  "It is obvious many of these birds are being taken illegally from the 
wild," a spokesman for the service said. 
  The new measures being considered include setting up three classes of 
licence for bird traders instead of one. 
  The Government is also likely to introduce new penalties which
could see dealers' licences downgraded or withdrawn if they trade in illegally
captured birds. 
  Mr John Whitehouse, director of the National Parks and Wildlife
Service, also said computers would be extensively used in the battle against
illegal trading. 
  "With all bird trading records on computer it is very 
simple to run cross checks to make sure dealings are above board," he said. 
  The service's officials believe popular targets for illegal trappers are 
Major Mitchell (pink) cockatoos, superb parrots, and regent parrots. 
  A spokesman for State Planning and Environment Minister, Mr Carr said changes 
would not go ahead immediately so comment from within the bird trading 
industry could be considered.

 <h> Hospitals bailed out for last time </h>

<bl> By Peter Grimshaw </bl>

THE State Government has had to find an extra $23 million to pull the top NSW 
public hospitals out of debt. 
  But the Health Minister, Mr Unsworth, warned yesterday that this was the 
last time the Government would rescue hospitals which overspent their budgets.
  He said hospital bosses would in future be required to stick within their
budgets or face the sack. 
  The State Opposition warned last week that many hospitals had run out of 
funds. 
  It predicted that patients would have to take their cut lunches with 
them to surgery unless the hospitals were given extra money. 
  Mr Unsworth disclosed that the major hospitals had built up debts of $8
million last financial year and a further $15 million this year. 
  He said some would be ordered to pay some of the debts themselves from 
funds they had "squirrelled away". 
  The Government would pay the rest of the bills immediately
but this was the last time hospitals could expect extra payouts, he said. 
  "One of the conditions of us allocating the extra funds is that hospitals 
give us an assurance that they will take any necessary steps to keep their 
spending patterns in line with their budgets in the future,"  he said. 
  "Already in the past two months hospitals have been able to make savings in 
some areas. 
  "But some other hospitals have continued on their merry way with little or no
regard for the financial burden already borne by the Government and taxpayers.
  "This means funds which could have been spread more evenly throughout the
health system are needed to prop up those hospitals which have not exercised
proper expenditure control measures." 
  The hospitals most in trouble were understood to be Royal Prince Alfred 
($9 million), St Vincents ($6 million) and Royal North Shore ($3.3 million). 
  Mr Unsworth agreed that some hospital authorities probably believed that 
if they got into financial trouble, the Government would always bail them 
out. 
  "But that won't be the case in future," he said. 
  "If hospitals don't accept their responsibilities and live within
their budgets, they will do so at their own peril." 
  Mr Unsworth said other areas of the State Budget would suffer as the 
Government found $23 million to pay the debts.

 <h> Strikes at record low </h>

THE number of working days lost through industrial disputes in the 12 months

Statistics said yesterday. 
  The ABS said 1,118,900 working days were lost in the 12 months to March, 
compared with 1,385,600 in the 12 months to March 1985 and 1,074,400 in the 
year ended April 1969. 
  A total of 60,100 working days were lost by 42,000 workers in 154 disputes 
in March compared with 120,500 days lost by 48,100 workers in 161 disputes in 
February. 
  A total of 84,500 days were lost because of industrial disputes in March 1985,
the ABS said.

 <h> Inventor seeks foreign backing </h>

<bl> By Peter Lowe </bl>

THE man judged Australian Inventor of the Year in 1980 says tax imposts are 
forcing him to seek overseas backing for his latest creation: a pocket-sized 
emergency safety beacon which may save the lives of snow skiers, hikers and 
other adventure seekers. 
  The sophisticated device, weighing only 160g, emits a continuous radio 
homing beacon which makes it usable in the most remote country. 
  But according to its inventor, Mr Iain Saul, import taxes of up to 30
per cent on components and a sales tax of 20 per cent make the cost of
producing it in Australia uneconomic. 
  In addition, Mr Saul has encountered difficulties in obtaining a frequency 
allocation for the mini safety beacon which emits a continuous signal for 60 
hours after it is activated. 
  "The Department of Civil Aviation didn't want the beacons transmitting 
because they thought people would set them off in a mischievous manner. 
  "The Department of Communications recognised the need for the beacon, 
took the bull by the horns and allocated a frequency," said Mr Saul. 
  "They made up their minds about six weeks ago at a meeting where the 
disappearance of Simon Crean's brother in the snow was mentioned," he said. 
  The beacon is designed for one-off use only, to discourage pranksters. 
  Despite a decision to manufacture the first batch at the small Consolidated 
Technology factory in the Melbourne suburb of Frankston,  the inventor, who 
is also managing director of Consolidated Technology, doubts whether 
manufacturing will prove practicable in Australia. 
  "There are virtually no manufacturers of electronic components any more in 
Australia.  There used to be a lot but they found it cheaper to manufacture 
overseas," he said.
  Consequently most components for the safety beacon must be imported and the
import tax ranges from 2 per cent to 30 per cent.

 <h> Kuta cashes in on devaluation bonus </h>

<bl> By Jeremy Clift </bl>

  INDONESIA'S big devaluation has turned the spectacular equatorial
archipelago of sparkling beaches and ancient temples into a bargain for
travellers.
  Sun-seekers on the holiday island of Bali can now get rooms for as little
as three of four dollars a night along Kuta Beach, a favourite with
back-packers.  
  The Indonesian airline Garuda is offering cut-price packages
if you buy the ticket abroad and the Indonesian government is mounting
a campaign to encourage visitors to cash in on last month's devaluation.
  The currency change means that tourists can get 45 per cent more rupiah
to the dollar, slashing the cost of meals, drinks and local transport.
  Indonesia, the only Asian member of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting
Countries, has been badly hit by the fall in the price of oil and devalued
on September 12, setting a new rate to the dollar of 1035 rupiah against
734 previously.
  Though many of Indonesia's better hotels are priced in US dollars, tourists
looking for bargains will find accommodation at rock bottom prices.
  Indonesia is a country of 13,000 islands with a population of 165 million
people that is mostly Moslem, though on Bali - the most popular tourist
destination - a mixture of Hindu and Buddhist culture predominates.
  Straddling the equator, the volcanic chain is strung out across a distance
broader than the United States and includes a fascinating kaleidoscope of
different peoples from near Stone Age tribes in the far eastern province
of Irian Jaya and former head-hunters in Borneo to the matriarchal society
of part of Western Sumatra.
  It will soon be easier than ever to get to Bali.
  From next month Garuda will open new flights to the resort island from
Amsterdam, Taipei, Guam and Los Angeles, says Garuda chief R.A.J. Lumenta.
  Because of these plans, Lumenta told reporters there was now a critical
need to improve Bali's small airport.
  Japan is providing a 14.9 billion yen (A$150 million) loan for the expansion
project, but it is not expected to get underway until October next year,
according to Transport Minister Rusmin Nurjadin.
  In the meantime, visitors may find frustrating delays at Bali's Ngurah
Rai airport.
  But it is still worth the wait.
  Despite fears that an influx of tourists will wreck Bali's colourful
culture, it has thrived on the visitors who help keep alive its traditional
dancing, wood carving, textile making and active artists' colony.
  The glitter of neon between the palms along Kuta Beach may be seen as
an unwelcome intrusion of the modern world by some, but Bali authorities
have wisely restricted tourist development to the extreme southern tip of
the island.
  The newest resort will open in December, when President Suharto is expected
to inaugurate the latest Club Mediterranee complex at the luxury development
of Nusa Dua.  President Reagan stayed at a nearby hotel last April.
  Suharto has called for a concerted effort to promote tourism to make up
for lost oil dollars.
  "We must realise how important the role of tourism is in ensuring the
continuity of our development efforts," he told a tourism conference in
Jakarta.
  The government aims to increase tourist arrivals by 14 per cent a year
in the present five-year plan ending in 1989.  But visitors to the country
rose by only 2.8 per cent to 720,647 last year from 700,910 in 1984.
  This is partly because Indonesia is expensive to get to from many parts
of the world.  But tourists also complain of poor standards of hygiene
in some places, high prices, cheating and poor service.
  "The quality of Indonesian tourism in terms of promotion, service, price,
attractions and management still leaves much to be desired in view of the
high rate of complaints by tourists visiting Indonesia,"  Tourism minister
Achmad Tahir admitted last month.

 <h> Peko asks for talks on Kakadu </h>

  PEKO-Wallsend chief Charles Copeman has called on Prime Minister Bob
Hawke to stall further development in the mineral-rich Kakadu National Park
until they can discuss issues involved in mining.
  In a letter to Mr Hawke, Mr Copeman has outlined five specific areas
he wishes to argue at the planned meeting.
  Mr Hawke has yet to receive the letter, sent on Tuesday, but a spokesman
said the Government had no objection in principle to further discussions
with Peko over the issue.
  The issues to be raised were detailed yesterday by Mr Geoffrey Sherrington,
the special projects manager for Geopeko, the subsidiary company operating
in Kakadu.
  The first was a clarification of the true position of traditional
Aboriginal claims*claimers of the land regarding mining operations.
  Production came to a halt at Robe River's Pannawonica mine during a visit
by Mr Copeman yesterday.

 <h> C'wealth outshines rival banks with record $289.2m </h>

  THE Commonwealth Bank Group boosted profit 21.5 per cent from $238.09
million to a record $289.2 million in the June 30 year.
  The result compares well with the half-yearly results of the other major
banks and largely flowed from higher levels of business and a slight widening
of interest margins on lending.
  Pre-tax profit rose 24 per cent from $359.5 million to $445.5 million,
while profit after tax and extraordinary items was $277.4 million, up 17
per cent on $237 million previously.
  Managing director, Vern Christie, said the results reflected the bank's
increased volume of offshore borrowings and assets, tight control of
costs and strong earnings from the foreign exchange division.
  The Commonwealth is now the second largest currency dealer by volume after
Westpac.
  The bank also received a $110 million dividend from its wholly-owned
susidiary, the Commonwealth Savings Bank, up from $30 million last year,
but this was not included in group profit.
  The Federal Government has claimed a record $100.5 million dividend from
the group, up from $22.6 million last year.
  The 1985-86 group result compares favourably with the National Australia
Bank's half yearly profit which was up 5.9 per cent to $153.4 million after
a record 30.1 percent rise to $301.7 million in the full year to September
30, 1985.
  The ANZ's interim profit was down 6.9 per cent to $141.9 million after
a 12.8 per cent rise to $283.0 million for the full year previously.
  Westpac posted a 5.8 per cent rise to $196.1 million after a 20.2 per
cent annual rise to $367.6 million.
  Mr Christie said the bank could not expect to maintain the 1985-86 profit
growth rate in 1986-87.
  Productivity rose from $7299 of profit produced by each employee in 1984-85
to $8668 for each of the 33,364 employees in 1985-86.
  Retail deposits increased only 5.5 per cent, or $1,035 million, in the
12 months, attributed entirely to the general deposit downturn in the banking
sector prior to the introduction of the housing package on April 2.
  Total deposits with the group rose 8.9 per cent to $23.1 billion.
  The savings deposit downturn held the Commonwealth Savings Bank's
contribution to group profit to $115.5 million, up only 3 per cent.
  Home lending totalled $2.17 billion in 1985-86 with $2.4 billion allocated
this year.
  Mr Christie was optimistic interest rates would decline in early 1987,
but said it was unlikely lower rates would flow through to home mortgages
without long-term stability in the Australian currency.

 <h> Industrials rise buoys market </h>

<bl>- with DONALD GRAHAM </bl>

  QUALITY industrial shares yesterday shrugged off the worsening economic
outlook and saved the share market from a sharp fall as they again moved
to record highs.
 The industrial share price index jumped another 10.8 points to reach
a record 2096.7 points, despite the announcement on Tuesday of another
disastrous balance of payments deficit of $1450 million for September
and forecast of a $2 billion deficit for October.
  Comforted by a lack of overseas reaction to the continuing trade deficits,
a phenomenon was evidenced when the Australian dollar rose during the
day to close at US64.4c and just under 45p against sterling.
  The recent boom in*booming Australian share markets has been attributed to 
overseas interest in Australian resource shares as a replacement for the South
African investments now restricted by worldwide sanctions.
  But it is emerging that local investors are propping up the quality
industrial market with continued buying*buyng of the leading stocks.
  Analysts are suggesting that Australian investors are starved of alternative
avenues for placing funds because of the uncertainties in the property
markets and by the tax implications of investing in fixed-interest
securities, with interest payments subject to tax rates up to the impending
universal 50c in the dollar.
  Share dividends appear likely to be tax-free after July 1 next year.
  So, the industrials index has now risen fairly steadily since 
September*Septeber 19, 1985, when it was at 1383, just as Treasurer Paul 
Keating announced his tax "imputation" system that laid the basis for 
tax-free dividends for Australian residents.
  After a trough caused by the initial "banana republic" description of
the economy's future, when the industrial index bottomed at 1742 on July 28,
it has risen 344 points, or just under 20 per cent.
  The strength during the day was aided by special situations and reaction
to various news releases.
  Sharp gains were once more made by:
  - Brambles Industries, which added another 20c to reach a record $7.50,
compared with only $6.30 at the start of October and $4.30 earlier in the
year.
  Brambles has attracted attention because of its surge in overseas operations,
including the skilfully-arranged acquisition of the major railway freight
business in European, CAIB, earlier this year.
 Only 39,000 Brambles shares were traded, indicating an emerging scrip
shortage.
  - Pacific Dunlop also continued to advance, this time with a 10c gain to
$3.80 and a trade in Melbourne of $3.81 during the day.
  - Burns Philp rose only 10c but reached $8 for the first time ever and
looking likely to move up further.
  Only 19,000 Burns Philp shares changed hands during the day and the stock
has moved from $7 to $8 during October with only 581,000 shares involved.
  - Peterville Sleigh completed its recovery after a recent dip caused
by a disappointing profit result by adding 5c to $2.20 after trading as
low as $1.75 last month.
  Only 56,000 Peterville*Petersville shares were traded.
  - The special situation stocks remained quiet, although Woolworths advanced
another 3c to $3.58 and traded as high as $3.65 in Melbourne during the
day.
  Only 37,800 shares were involved on the six exchanges, compared with the
multi-million turnovers earlier in the month when Ron Brierley's Industrial
Equity was establishing an 18 per cent shareholding and raising thoughts
of a raid on the retailer.
  Meanwhile, Coles Myer advanced 10c to $5.50, the best since the speculative
trading earlier in the year caused a freak $6.50 all-time high.
  Only 165,000 shares changed hands with Coles Myer returning a dividend
yield of only 3.8 per cent at the new price.
  Herald and Weekly Times calmed down after a similar move by Industrial
Equity in establishing a 14 per cent shareholding at $6.50 caused the
shares to jump to $7.70 late last week.
  Only 45,000 shares were traded, all at $7.66, just 4c below the all-time
record.
  But it was News Corp that once more led the media section higher.
  News shares rose 70c to 33.20 and traded during the day at a remarkable
all-time high of $33.50 when overseas orders bolstered the market.
  News Corp has now risen from $28.50 at the start of October, from $23
at the start of September and from a low of $9 earlier in the year.
  It trades carrying a 1-for-1 bonus issue.  The 129,000 shares traded
yesterday cost investors, largely overseas, a total of $4.3 million.
  So far this year, 36.78 million News Corp shares have been traded on
Australian share markets at a cost of $674.6 million, whereas last year
only 23.8 million News shares were traded at a cost of only $205 million.
  Bank shares were treated with caution as the US dollar reflected
uncertainty about Third World debts and the effect of any failure on the
US banking structure.
  National rose 4c but was countered with 4c falls by both the ANZ and
Westpac.

<h> WHY MORE SAY NO TO MARRIAGE </h>

<bl>- BY MICHAEL O'DONNELL </bl>

DE-FACTO relationships are being dubbed the "arrangment of the 80s" by marriage
counsellors.
  Latest figures from the Bureau of Statistics show a marked decrease in
the number of people under the age of 20 getting married.
  Males under 20 made up less than one per cent of all marriages in 1985
(nine per cent in 1971) and females only 10 per cent (31 per cent in 1971).
  Mrs Gelinda Spencer of the Family Life Marriage Counselling Service, says
the figures show up the latest trend among young people.
  "There is less pressure on young people to marry because they now have
the socially accepted option of living together," said Mrs Spencer.
  She said people prefer to trial a marriage-type situation first without
the commitment but added it is really a farce.
  "It is not*now a real indication of how a married relationship will fare because
the individuals have the immediate option of getting out.
  "My colleagues and I believe those statistics will continue to fall and
the incidence*incidents of de-facto relationships will rise," she said.

FIRST came the Pope Mobile, then Pope T-shirts - and now it's the "Popescope".
  An Adelaide man has just won church approval for a cardboard and glass
periscope to enable short people in crowds to see the Pope during his visit

  The national papal tour office yesterday gave schoolteacher Paul Doherty

 <h>42 INJURED ON FUN PARK RIDE </h>

FORTY-two people were injured when a roller coaster train crashed into
the rear of another which had stopped too soon at an amusement park in western
Japan.
  Two people were injured seriously while the others suffered mild shock
and nosebleeds after bumping into the seats in front of them, said Hirokichi
Ueda, an official at the Nagashima Spaland amusement park, 300kms west of
Tokyo.
  Ueda said one 28-seat train was just finishing its run yesterday when
it crashed into another which had accidentally stopped 13m short of the boarding
station.                                                               
  The incoming train was travelling at 5-6km/h and both trains were filled
to capacity, he said.

 <h> BOY STILL ON WALKABOUT </h>

THERE is still no sign of Vaucluse schoolboy James Wolfe, who may be wandering
Sydney with amnesia.
  James, 15, who suffers from epilepsy and needs regular medication, went
walking last Thursday and did not return home.
  Since then there have been sightings in the eastern suburbs and in the
City.
  Last December James, paddling on a surf ski in the Harbour, failed to come
home and was presumed drowned, but next day he was found paddling the ski
west of the Harbour Bridge and returned home unhurt.

 <h> BEER TIPPED TO DRY UP </h>

BEER shortages are expected to start in Sydney by the end of the week.
  Some liquor suppliers have taken on extra stocks to prepare for an expected
escalation of a superannuation dispute involving brewery employees.
  Reports have indicated small outlets could be dry by the end of the week.
  Beer production in NSW at Tooheys and CUB has been halved.
  And a spokesman for the Bond Corporation, brewers of Tooheys, Fourex and
Swan, warned of severe shortages.
 "If we cannot reach agreement, beer will dry up around the country," said
brewing chief executive, Mr Bill Widerberg.
  "We cannot understand why the unions are pressing for another scheme
in an industry which is well serviced by excellent superannuation facilities."
  The NSW dispute will go before the Arbitration Commission today.
  Meanwhile, more than one third of Victorian hotels have run out of beer
on tap - and packaged supplies are starting to dry up.
  The action, involving six unions, has also spread to Queensland and Western
Australia.
  President of the Australian Hotels Association, Mr Daryl Washington, said
casual employees could be stood down by Wednesday.  Sixty per cent of
Victoria's 45,000 hotel employees are casuals.
  Brewers have already stood down workers who cannot usefully be employed.
  And south-East Queensland could face beer shortages as thirsty southerners
launched "beer raids" from across the border.

<h> Drug judge report shakes NSW Govt </h>

  THE State Government was rocked today by a potentially new scandal over
the sentences handed out to drug offenders by a NSW judge.
  While the Opposition called for a judicial inquiry, Attorney-General
Mr Sheahan admitted that if suggestions made about the judge were proved
correct it would amount to "a monstrous perversion of justice".
  The row was triggered by the findings of a study of the NSW legal system,
which was funded by the Australian Criminology Research Council.
  According to the report, which was leaked to The Sydney Morning Herald,
a NSW District Court judge appeared to have exercised selective leniency
in dealing with defendants represented by a particular solicitor.

 <h> A BIT OF A JOLT FOR JOGGERS </h>

MEN who take up marathon running to improve their health may find the exercise
denting their masculine pride.
  Researchers in America have discovered that too much running can cause
a man's testes to shrink.
  A study of six men who had run at least 125 kilometres a week for the
past five years, and could finish a marathon in less than two hours and
45 minutes, has come up with the shattering news.
  Susan MacConnie, of the University of Michigan, said none of the men reported
any sexual problems - but all had hormonal abnormalities which might eventually
cause the shrinking.
  They were deficient in a key hormone which sparks off activity in the testes
and eventually, reproductive hormones.

POLITICIANS and bureaucrats beware.
  Psychologists can now read behind the rhetorical statement.
  The political rhetoric of world leaders is providing American psychologist
Dr Philip Tetlock with an accurate indicator of what politicians really
think about important issues.
  For example, the soft-line literary use of language currently shown by
the Soviet leader, Mr Gorbachev, tells him that Mr Gorbachev would be
prepared to reach a major agreement with the US.
  But Dr Tetlock has found the current US administration more sceptical
in outlook than any administration in the last 12 years.

<h> HOMES: PRICE IS NOT RIGHT! </h>

POTENTIAL sellers appeared to be holding back on the sale of their homes,
possibly waiting for prices to pick up.
  And those who placed their property on the market were seeking a higher
price than what their home was worth, according to a national survey by
the Real Estate Institute of Australia.
  The institute commented that these owners did not seem to realise in
general prices were depressed, and in some cities still slipping downwards.
  Agents in Sydney found that the stock of houses for sale continued to
decline, with many claiming that "realistically priced good listings were
very difficult to obtain."
  More than half of agents surveyed said they had the lowest number of listings
since May.
  The survey, covering the month of July, said that some agents commented
that unless vendors price their properties more realistically sales market
activity is likely to remain low.
  In Sydney, most houses sold in Sydney in July were priced between $90,000
and $110,000.

 <h>36 survive coach plunge off highway </h>

THIRTY-five people, including children and an expectant mother, were injured
today when a western Sydney-based coach crashed off the Pacific Highway.
  Many were thrown from their seats, hit the roof and fell to the aisle of
the Brisbane-bound coach.
  Five of the injured were seriously hurt.
  The crash occurred about 1.45 am, four kilometres from Kew, north of Taree,
on the Mid-North Coast and involved a coach operated by Advance Express
Coachlines, of Penrith.
  The bus was on a regular overnight service from Sydney to Brisbane via
the Gold Coast.
  Thirty-six people, including two drivers, were aboard.
  The bus left the highway on a slight bend, went to the incorrect side
of the highway and ploughed about 80 metres through bush before hitting
a large sign and several trees.
  "It also bounced over a two-metre deep drain which jolted most of the
passengers from their seats," Constable Rod Scarr, of Port Macquarie police,
said later.
  "The bus stayed on its wheels but the front and the undersection were
damaged.
  "People were thrown against the roof and came down into the aisle or on
seats in front of them.
  "The co-driver suffered head injuries and an expectant mum was hurt, too."
  A passing motorist saw the bus standing between the highway and just
two metres from the main northern rail line and raised the alarm.
  Six ambulances from four towns and police from Kew and Port Macquarie
went to the scene.
  They found several passengers still in the coach unable to move because
of injuries.
  In a three-hour operation ambulance officers treated the injured and took
28 to hospitals in Port Macquarie and seven to Taree.
  Additional doctors, n	urses and paramedic staff were called in to Hastings
District Hospital, Port Macquarie at 3.30 am to help.
  Three of the injured passengers, two men aged 32 and 42 and a woman, 55,
were admitted in a serious condition.
  Acting executive officer at the hospital, Mr Kim Everson, said the expectant
mother and her unborn baby were all right.

  "But I believed in myself so I got right underneath her and I caught her."
  The boy saw Sara Wolf standing on a table near an open second-storey window

 <h> SUCCESS AND THE JONES BOY </h>

<bl> By Janise Beaumont </bl>

<h> THE MAN WHO TALKED THE GREEN AND GOLDS TO GLORY TALKS ABOUT HIS FAVOURITE SUBJECT </h>

  THERE'S a Frank Sinatra song that ends: "Here's to the winners all of us can
be."
  So tell that to the country's 650,000 unemployed you say? And to those who
are always unlucky in love?
  Alan Jones, the man who has motivated our Green and Golds to Rugby glory and
who leaves shortly to try to do the same for the Bond camp in Perth, agrees
with Sinatra.
  He adds: "The values required to succeed in one field of human endeavour are
exactly the same as those required to succeed in any other."
  After coming off air at 2UE, in his speedy and always-enthusiastic way, Jones
talked about what it takes to come out on top.
  "You have to understand your weaknesses and your strengths. Then be happy
with what you are and confident about what you MAY be and don't be deterred.
  "This is a country where we tend to be embarrassed about our potential and at
the moment we live in an incentive-less society. The permissive 60s gave us
permission to fail.
  "Not only that, but everyone wants to believe that winning's difficult - it's
not.
  "What's important is not to give up.
  "Joan Sutherland was a typist till she took a chance on going overseas.
  "And Sir Donald Bradman - I've just written a forward to a new book about him
- was smashing all the records while he was being told he couldn't do it.
  "We don't live in a country that cultivates success and in what I do I try to
break that down.
  "I say to players: `Do you want to be the best in the world? Well let me know
if you do - otherwise cheerio'.
  "Then I tell them: `You'll be vilified and your motives will be questioned
and it'll be hard work - but worth it'."
  True as God he doesn't stop for a second, and the effort of what he says and
the way he leans forward as though you're the only one in the world he wants to
pass his message onto - well, it's mesmerising.
  Makes a person want to rush out and join a softball team or build a better
mousetrap.
  And speaking of better and best consumer goods - Alan has a bone to pick
with Prime Minister Bob Hawke over his recent address to the nation.
  "He conujured up images of great and successful Australians and virtually
challenged us to strive to be like them. Then after he told us to be like
Sutherland and de Costella - in the next breath he told us to buy Australian,
even if it's second best."
  Back to the blueprint for winning:
  "In sport, as in everything else, if your values are wrong, your attitude is
wrong, your strategy is wrong and your preparation is wrong, then it's on the
scoreboard.
  "In life we don't keep the score unless it counts, do we?"
  On working with a team: "One incentive is the team itself," he said.
  Referring to the Wallabies: "We're mates, inextricably locked together. That
loyalty and mateship can move mountains.
  "At Eden Park we won because we're mates - that's an ingredient in success."
  And when the inevitable losses come: "I don't whinge when I lose - nobody
hears me make excuses."
  He agreed there has to be a period of mourning after any kind of loss ...
There's got to be room for sentiment.
  "When we lost at Canterbury we grieved and I don't care who knows it. Then
you come back with a greater commitment to regenerate and regroup."
  It seems we're never too young or too old to make use of these pholosophies.
  "The other day I said to a 19-year-old: `Do you want to be the best in the
world? - because I think you can be' - the bloke's stunned - `Well yes, as long
as you don't tell anybody'.
  "This bloke's life has been turned around forever.

 <h> KEN PAYS HIS DUES </h>

<bl> By TONY MEGAHEY </bl>

It had been a while but Ken Salisbury felt at home amidst the blood, sweat
and liniment at Newtown Police Boys' club.
  The former Commonwealth light middleweight champion nodded his approval
as big Joe Bugner swapped thunderclaps with the bull-like Tongan Tony
Fulilangi.  
  And Salisbury shook his head at the sheer strength of Jeff Fenech in a 
sparring session.
  "When you've been away you miss it a lot," Salisbury said.
  "But Bugner really surprises me.
  "You've got to give it to him - he's super fit considerng his age.
  "He's worked hard at it and he'll still give them a fight."
  Then Salisbury stunned the onlookers when he produced a photo for big
Joe to autograph.
 It was the 1970 Liverpool amateur boxing and dinner show.
  Joe was presenting the trophies.
  "Joe was the great white hope then," Salisbury said.
  "And over the years I feel the man hasn't really been given his dues as
a very good heavyweight fighter.
  "I mean he took a legend the distance twice - Muhammed Ali.
  "And Bugner fought Frazier at his peak.
  "Bugner is tough - neither could put him down."  
  There's no comeback though for Salisbury.
  A car accident last year, not a pair of lethal boxing gloves, ended his
career.
  Severe neck and hip injuries make it an endurance test for Salisbury to
train.
  But Salisbury is embarking on the next best course for a man who still
loves the fight game.
  "I'm taking my exams to be a fight trainer - to put something back into
the game," Salisbury said today.
  "I'd love to work with some of the kids in the way Johnny Lewis does it
here at Newtown."
  Maybe one day Salisbury will proudly present an amateur trophy to some
wide eyed youngster.

 <h> FRAZIER BEATING TIPPED FOR JOE </h>

<bl> By PETER KOGOY </bl>

LEON Tabbs was in Smokin' Joe Frazier's corner the night Joe Bugner went
the distance with the world heavyweight champ.
  Tabbs was also there when a new generation Frazier, Marvis, pummelled
Bugner into submission over 10 rounds three years ago.
  He'll also be in the opposite corner at the Sydney Entertainment Centre
on Friday night when David Bey, Tabbs' latest protege, fights Bugner in
his second comeback fight.
  Tabbs handled the affairs of such ring luminaries as Benny Briscoe, Boogaloo
Watts, Marvin Johnson and Jerry "The Bull" Martin.
 "They all fought out of the 23rd Police Athletic Gym in 
Philadelphia*Philadephlia," says the well-credentialled trainer.
  "David Bey's style is very similar to Smokin' Joe's kid, Marvis," Tabbs
said.
  "Bey throws a strong right bomb and possesses a vicious left hook, so
quick that Bugner won't know where it'll come from," he added.
  Tabbs, not noted for making predictions, tipped Bugner's latest comeback
to be short-lived.
  "My boy is world class, sharp and a real hustler in the ring.
  "There's no way we've come this far to lose."

 <h> TREVOR FACES DEATH AGAIN </h>

<h> DON'T RIDE AGAIN - DOCTOR </h>

<bl> From JOHN BILIC in MELBOURNE </bl>

JUMPS jockey Trevor Webb has already put life's biggest hurdles behind him.
  Two weeks after being critically injured in a race fall at Werribee,
south-west of Melbourne, Webb is planning to defy family and medical advice
to ride again.
 "The fall has put a bit of wind up me, but I can't really wait until I
get back into it," he said.
  "It's something I've been brought up with."
  On October 27, Webb's*Webb mount Fair Smuggler fell and two other horses crashed
onto him.
  "I don't remember a thing after I went over," he said.
  A year ago Webb, 24, was involved in a race fall at Bendigo and was twice
declared clinically dead on his way to hospital.  
  Despite doctors telling him not to ride, Webb was quickly back in the saddle.
  This time, his family and doctors think it would be unwise to ride again.
  "I told them we would just see how it goes," he said.
  Webb, who suffered a badly fractured skull, will soon undergo another
operation.

 <h> Star brims with a love for people </h>

<bl> By GLENN ROBBINS </bl>

WAVERLEY Star's biggest asset in his Japan Cup lead-up is his preference
for humans, according to rider Lance O'Sullivan.
  Which is a rather unusual but huge plus for Waverley Star's preparation
considering he is segregated from other horses.
  "He doesn't mind being the only horse in a 20-stall complex," Lance said.
  "He's always preferred the company of humans to other horses.
  "It is hard to define why, but that's just his nature.
  "He's contented having the company of Paul (brother Paul O'Sullivan,
the co-trainer) and his strapper."
  Waverley Star emphasised his chances in Sunday week's Cup with an effortless
win in Tokyo over 1800m last Sunday.
  "He's pulled up perfectly and everything is fine," trainer Dave O'Sullivan
said from New Zealand today.
  But not so with the other Australasian representative, Cox Plate winner
Bonecrusher.
  Reports claim Bonecrusher has been fretting since beginning his
seven-day quarantine period last Saturday, which is no surprise since he's
a gelding.
  Bonecrusher is going into the Cup without local track experience and a
race for four weeks, whereas Waverley Star has proved he has fully adapted
to his new surroundings.
  Despite the great Australian interest in Sunday week's Cup, no television
network is willing to screen the race because of the fee asked by the Japan
Racing club.

 <h> BOWLER'S BEST </h>

<h> CAVALRY'S ALL CLASS </h>

<bl> by GLENN ROBBINS </bl>

EXCITING three-year-old Cavalry has a devoted fan in the VRC handicapper
Jim Bowler.
 The lightly raced Cavalry emerged as a top prospect at Flemington when
he won the 1100m Black Douglas Stakes on November 1 and a 1400m welter the
following Saturday.
  "I thought Cavalry was one of the top three three-year-olds to come out
of our Spring Carnival," Bowler said.
  "His win last Saturday was outstanding.
  "He just left those seasoned horses stranded when he accelerated at the
400m and he maintained his run right to the post.
  "I think Cavalry will eventually prove himself a very classy horse."
  The other high ranking three-year-olds in Bowler's assessment were Victoria
Derby winner Raveneaux and King Of Brooklyn.
  Cavalry gets the test of his career in the $75,000 Sandown Guineas (1600m)
on Saturday.
  He has risen sharply in distance from 1100m two weeks ago but if he settles
in Saturday's race he's going to take running down.
  But if Cavalry doesn't get speed to allow him to relax, then he could
be tested running out the tough Sandown mile.
  Craig Dinn has been booked for stablemate Western Ace in the Guineas
while Harry White has the Cavalry mount.
  Part-owner Ernie Smith says Western Ace is on trial for the Perth Derby
double and claims his three-year-old will stay the 2400m.
  But the man standing between a Tommy Smith Guineas win on Saturday is
their stable jockey Mick Dittman.
  Dittman is sticking with boom Adelaide three-year-old King Of Brooklyn
who looked definite Derby material when he bolted in at Flemington over
2000m on November 6.
  King Of Brooklyn's problem on Saturday is switching back in distance but
Sandown will help him," Dittman said.
  "But if this horse can improve over the next month he could make a clean
sweep of the two Derbies in Perth.

THE New Zealand breeders of Myocard and Cardiac might well believe Aussies
are a heartless bunch. 
  But shrewd, when it comes to fair play, might be more accurate.

 <h> Huddled masses yearning for kitsch </h>

<bl> By DAVID DALE </bl>

  NEW YORK, Sunday: Five million Americans answered President Reagan's call 
to crowd into New York at the weekend and "celebrate liberty". Most of them 
honoured the 100th birthday of the statue in the harbour by wearing green 
foam-rubber crowns, wandering round the streets holding beer cans, and 
singing the national anthem again and again.
  But some New Yorkers celebrated liberty in other ways: 
- Five thousand of the city's 11,000 taxi drivers went on strike for the 
weekend, complaining that they have not been allowed to raise their fares 
for six years. 
  A ride on a bus or subway became the embodiment of the phrase "huddled 
masses, yearning to breathe free". Michael Higgins, president of the Taxi 
Owners Guild, said: "We showed them.  They'll take us seriously now." 
- Italian and Polish organisations held protest meetings to complain that 
there were no Italians or Poles among the 12 "ethnic Americans" who received 
medals of honour from Mr Reagan (the list included Bob Hope and Henry 
Kissinger). 
  The ceremony was intended to honour the statue's symbolism of America 
opening its "golden door" to the oppressed masses of Europe, but the Mayor 
of New York, Ed Koch, labelled the selection of the 12 medal winners as 
"idiotic". Mr Koch, who is up for re-election soon, held his own hastily 
organised counter-ceremony, in which he gave "Liberty Awards" to 86 
immigrants. 
  The next day, newspaper opinion polls showed 60 per cent of New
Yorkers believe America has accepted too many immigrants and should close its
golden door. 
- The Elvis Presley impersonators of America protested that the 200
Elvises appearing in the weekend's closing ceremony (along with the 500 banjo
pluckers, 300 tap dancers, and 500 marching girls) were not real Elvis
impersonators but simply dancers in black wigs who would mime to Elvis
recordings. 
  Their spokesman, a man named Lee Elvis, of East Flatbush, who has
been impersonating The King professionally for 16 years, said: "They could have
done it with taste.  They could have had maybe the top 10 impersonators and done
it right.  But this - this is just a mockery." 
- About 500 homeless people held a 28 hour sit-in at Battery Park, the centre 
of festivities in lower Manhattan, protesting against the expenditure of $30 
million on the events of Liberty Weekend. 
- Close to 2,000 homosexuals marched through southern Manhattan in
protest against the US Supreme Court's ruling last week that homosexual acts
could be declared illegal.  They chanted "Not the church, not the state, we
alone decide our fate" and "What do we want? Oral sex. When do we want it?
Now." 
  But they had failed to obtain a police permit to celebrate liberty in
this way.  When they reached Wall Street, which borders the area most crowded
with visitors, the marchers met a wall of helmeted police, holding clubs. They
turned back, and then several of them were attacked by people in the crowd.  Two
men were taken to hospital, and the protest march dispersed. 
- Human rights groups picketed the Esmeralda, Chile's entry in the Liberty 
Weekend festival of 22 tall ships, because it was used as a detention centre 
and torture chamber after the military coup in Chile in 1973. 
  The organisers of the weekend had refused to ban the Esmeralda from 
participating, saying they did not want to "politicise" the event. 
- Residents of Jersey City, which overlooks the Statue of Liberty from the 
other side of the harbour, demanded that Liza Minelli not be allowed to sing 
New York, New York at the weekend's closing ceremony, because Jersey City 
has more of a claim to the statue than New York, and anyway, the closing 
ceremony was being held in a stadium in New Jersey.  Liza Minelli sang
it anyway. 
- Members of an organisation called Jews For Jesus moved through the
crowds in southern Manhattan handing out a pamphlet which warned: "Saving a
symbol isn't enough". "Our economy, world politics and disintegrating personal
relationships may soon undo us. It cost God a bundle, but he was willing to pay
the price.  Yshua gave his life, his blood so that we could be healed." 
  But nearly everybody else had a great time, particularly the souvenir 
vendors.  On Saturday afternoon, Mervin Bendewald, running a stall near 
Battery Park, said: "It's a madhouse."  His stall offered more than 100 
items ranging in price from $2 for an official liberty cigarette lighter to 
$295 for a two-metre green plexiglass replica of the statue. Mr Bendewald had 
only sold one plexiglass statue by Saturday afternoon, but he'd sold 200 
official Statue of Liberty shower curtains for $32 each, and was doing brisk 
business in Liberty pewter thimbles for $7, moulded plastic torches just like 
the one held by the statue for $12, and sunglasses with one lens coated with 
stars for $12. 
  Mr Bendewald was also offering the chance to have your photo taken with 
Lee Iacocca for $5, using a life-size cardboard cutout of Mr Iacocca, the 
chairman of the Liberty Restoration Fund.  Mr Iacocca, also chairman of 
Chrysler, is currently the most popular man in America, and he spent most of 
the weekend denying suggestions by television reporters that he should stand 
for president in 1988. 
  But Mr Bendewall's biggest seller by far was the green foam rubber crowns. 
On Friday alone he sold 3,000 of them at $3 each, in spite of the fact that 
nearby vendors had cut their prices to $2. 
  Mayor Koch offered this advice when asked about the commercialising of the 
Liberty weekend: "Rush to the stores and buy all the kitsch you can because 
in 100 years you're going to make a fortune - that's the history of kitsch." 
  If the weekend proved anything, it proved that there is no limit to 
Americans' taste for excess.  You might have thought things had gone far 
enough when Jennifer Stewart, 28, of Iowa City, won the national Lady Liberty 
look-alike competition by painting herself green, and putting a broken 
laundry basket on her head. 
  But then the Carnegie Deli presented Mr Iacocca with a replica of the 
statue, made with 30 kilograms of chopped liver.  And an artist named Peter 
Rocha produced a metre-square mosaic of the statue in jellybeans. 
  As the weekend went on, it seemed perfectly normal to hear a television 
commentator filling in time before President Reagan arrived to switch on the 
laser lights for the statue in this way: 
"You know, in addition to the sights and sounds we're bringing you here, 
there's something else I wish I could share with you.  There's a smell in the 
air here.  I can detect it.  It's the sweet smell of liberty." 
  The Liberty Weekend is over now, the millions have returned to their small 
towns all over America, and it might seem that nothing - certainly not 
Australia's Bicentennial celebrations - could ever top it for spectacle and 
excess. 
  But remember that planning is already under way here for the 500th 
anniversary of Christopher Columbus's discovery of America.  See you here in 
1992.

<h> A renaissance man with a view of reality  </h>

British actor Denholm Elliott is in heavy demand and the secret
of his success, he believes, is insecurity. 

<bl> PAUL BYRNES reports. </bl>

  AFTER a thespian career spanning 40 years and 75 films, Denholm Elliott 
remains prone to insecurity. 
  "I find that whenever anybody shakes my confidence, I'm no good," the 
64-year-old actor said last week from his home in London. 
  Whether this relates to his beginnings in drama is unclear, but that time 
was certainly traumatic.  He enrolled at the London's Royal Academy of 
Dramatic Art (RADA) in 1939, aged 17. 
  "I was very nervous and very insecure and had just left school
and all these young people were having mad affairs with each other and were
terribly grown up and sophisticated.  I felt completely out of place," he said.
  He was asked to leave after one term.  "They said I had no talent and was
wasting my money and their time and would I please just go away." 
  His revenge has been his success.  There is probably no other English 
character actor who is more constantly in demand at the moment, nor one whose 
work in small roles in the last 20 years is as consistently memorable. 
  You may remember him from Alfie, or King Rat, The Night They Raided 
Minskies, Brimstone and Treacle, Blade On The Feather (in which he was the 
sinister butler), Bad Timing, Trading Places (another butler), The Razor's 
Edge (as the foppish uncle) or A Private Function (the snobbish doctor).  
His latest role is in a marvellous adaptation of E.M. Forster's comic novel, 
A Room with a View, in which he plays Mr Emerson, a free-thinking English 
eccentric, and his performance is remarkably vivid. 
  "I have had a bit of a renaissance in the last few years," he agreed. "
I don't know if that's because everyone else is dead... I just seem to
have found a confidence and style that people seem to want. 
  "I feel very much at ease in front of the lens now, whereas I used to be 
very nervous.  I don't watch other actors at work much and I don't go to the 
theatre or cinema.  I'd rather play golf or tend my garden. 
  "I think if you are involved in each other's work all the time you tend to 
get over-exposed to each other.  You can see that in the way that Hollywood 
actors do a love scene. It's always the same." 
  And as for being insecure, he wouldn't be anything else. 
  "I don't know another actor I admire who isn't.  It is one's raison 
d'etre, the reason to do it, trying to find an identity and wanting 
approval.  Or something like that.
  "I think I will always be like that and I don't think if I wasn't I would be
any good. My observance of life would not be as sharp. 
  Elliot was born in 1922, the son of a barrister and grandson of a King's 
Counsel. His family lived then in Ealing, but later moved upmarket to the 
town of Malvern, which he didn't like any better. 
  After the disastrous debut at RADA, he joined the airforce and
was shot down over Europe.  His address for the next three years was Stalag
344, near Breslau, and that's where his acting career began. 
  "We had nothing else to do, so we built our own theatre.  The Germans, 
being very culture-conscious, allowed us to do plays for a while, until 
Hitler banned entertainment and we were put in chains. 
  "I started an underground theatre then in the huts, at night with 
clandestine sets and concealed lighting." 
  The Red Cross sent them scripts and the prisoners did plays like Arms and 
the Man, Pygmalion, Macbeth and The Philadelphia Story. 
  Back in England after the war, he joined the Amersham Repertory Company, 
then the Windsor Rep and was spotted by Laurence Olivier, who cast him in 
Venus Observed, and later as the lead in Ring Around The Moon on 
Broadway. 
  In the early 50s he had a film contract with Alexander Korda.  "He put me 
under contract and paid me and I sat on my arse for five years," he says now, 
which is not strictly true.  He appeared in movies like The Holly And The 
Ivy, Those Who Dare, The Heart Of the Matter and The Cruel Sea. 
  But his  career slowed down in the late 50s.
  "The `kitchen sink' with Osborne and all that lot was in, and I was not really
`kitchen sink' style, with my family background.  I didn't scratch my arse
enough or something. 
  "I do think people develop at different ages.  My career only really 
started in earnest in Station Six - Sahara, made in 1963.  I
think with Nothing But The Best, which followed that, I started to become a
character actor.
  He now prefers films to theatre, because of the freedom it allows.

Martina Navratilova has been a fearsome competitor on the tennis court. 
Last week there was cause to fear the Wimbledon champion for another reason
when a pistol was detected in her luggage at San Francisco International
Airport. The pistol was confiscated, but Navratilova was not arrested and
no action was taken.  Airport officials said that she had a licence for the
gun in Texas but not in California and that she could petition San Mateo
County Court for its return.  All of that is fine, but it doesn't answer
the question of what the pistol was doing there in the first place.  Navratilova
said at the time it had been put there accidentally by a friend who was
helping her to pack.  Two days ago Navratilova admitted that she owned the
gun but was not aware that it was in her baggage.  She said she bought the
.38 calibre Smith and Wesson in 1984 after a string of murders in her Texas
neighbourhood.  "I'm glad that they ended up finding the gun," she said.
 "I would have been mortified to find out later that it was in my purse
and they didn't find it.  Then I really would be scared." 
  Boxing matches are strenuous events, and not only for those in the ring.
 On Tuesday Britain's Frank Bruno knocked out South African Gerrie Coetzee
after 110 seconds of the first round.  The South African, appropriately
from a place just outside Johannesburg called Boxburg, was sent through
the ropes by the force of Bruno's final blow.  Unconscious, the only thing
that prevented him from falling from the ring was a photographer, who
reportedly worked up quite a sweat in the 15 seconds he supported Coetzee
before aid arrived.
  Consumer affairs authorities are urging those who buy swimwear that becomes
transparent when wet to demand a refund or ask for an exchange.  The Consumer
Affairs Commissioner, Mr Philip Holt, said that such swimwear did not fit
the purpose of body covering.  He said consumers were protected under the
Trade Practices Law if they bought swimwear that was faulty or did not "suit"
its purpose.

<h> Ice-cool enigma gets a kick out of being a loner </h>

<bl> By MICHAEL COCKERILL </bl>

Diplomacy has never been Marshall Soper's strong point.  Indeed the 25-year-old
multi-talented soccer player seems to have spent most of his career building
bridges only to happily knock them down again.
  Why a man with so much to play for has a history of self-destruction is
an enigma.  Among the people Soper has been associated with few can truly
claim to know what makes him tick.
  Many have tried, and failed.  Of all the coaches Soper has had since he
arrived on the national league scene with Apia Leichhardt in 1981 only Manfred
Schaefer, his current boss at Sydney Olympic, can boast a worthwhile
relationship.
  Yet Soper is not an offensive character.  He wishes no-one harm. Nor is
he preoccupied with criticising the game that has given him so much.
  But he is exasperating.  He is a loner.  He is confident to the point of
being headstrong.  And he has demonstrated on countless occasions that
he can be frustratingly unpredictable.
  For all his clashes with authority, however, Soper has few regrets. 
It is almost as if he wants to force whatever issue is at hand until it
reaches breaking point. Then he can enjoy the reaction.
 It is a style which often lands him in trouble, although Soper is comfortable
with that.  Controversy is a constant, almost reassuring, companion.
  That is why he is always building bridges.  And that is why his latest
reconstruction project leads him to the door of national coach Frank Arok.
  Arok has already forgiven Soper once.  When he ignored a curfew while
the Socceroos were preparing for a game against England in Brisbane in 1983
he was sent home.  Arok said then: "If 17 players can stick to the rules
and not play up why should I tolerate one man doing as he likes?"
  Even as he said it, however, Arok knew that with the 1985 qualifying rounds
of the World Cup approaching he could not ignore a player of such goal-scoring
talents.  Soper returned to the squad and to all observers it seemed a fait
accompli that he would spearhead the Socceroos' World Cup attack alongside
skipper John Kosmina.
  But Soper, the master of surprise revealed an ace up his sleeve just
days before the first World Cup qualifier against New Zealand in Auckland.
 Two years of training camps, preparation games and team talks went out
the window as he withdrew from the World Cup squad for "personal reasons".
  Once again the thunderclouds descended on Soper's Raymond Terrace home.
 Once again he was centre stage as the drama unfolded around him.
  Even the most hardened Soper cynics found it hard to believe he could
throw away the chance of a lifetime for reasons which most other players in
the squad chose to ignore.  Sure, it was tough financially to go on the
road with the Socceroos but such sacrifices came with the job.
  SO AROK did what he had to do.  He got rid of Soper.  In came David Mitchell
and he performed so well that he has since landed a lucrative contract with
the German Bundesliga club Eintracht Frankfurt.  
  At one stage, midway through the campaign, Soper made noises to return
through the back door.  But it is no secret that had Arok relented he would
have had a players' revolt on his hands.
  So Soper, who would have been a key figure in what was a glorious, if
ultimately unsuccessful, campaign got his kicks only in front of the TV
set.  And for one of the few times in his life he regrets what happened.
  "Looking back, I guess I should have stayed," he said.
  "When I played my first game for the Socceroos (January 1983 v New Zealand
in Auckland) the thrill of pulling on that green-and-gold shirt was tremendous.
It was a great honour, and that made it very difficult to give up.
  "I might not get another chance to play in the World Cup, and that is
hard to take.  I got wrapped up in the whole thing last year, but it was
painful to watch.
  "Now I've got only one thing on my mind - to get back into the team. 
And I'd like to think that if I keep scoring goals then Frank (Arok) won't
be able to ignore me.
  "As for the other players, I've got no apprehensions. A true player always
thinks the best players available should play in the team, and I think I'm
the most complete striker in the country."
  Soper has the credentials to back up his claims.  Since he left the
now-defunct Northern NSW State League club Stewart and Lloyds to join Apia
five seasons ago he has notched 65 goals, making him one of top 10 all-time
scorers in the national league. 
  IN THAT time he has had a number of clashes with his coaches, but his
form in front of goal has never waned. It even survived the most turbulent
period of his career, when he was involved in a running battle with Tommy
Docherty while the flamboyant Scotsman was at the helm of Olympic.
  "I never liked him - simple as that," Soper said.  " I thought he came
out here for a holiday.  He treated the game as a joke.  
  I didn't think it was right that someone who was getting so much from soccer
should behave that way.  He was always abusing me in the press, complaining
about my attitude and my playing style.  
  "I was glad to see him go, but even during the worst times I kept scoring
goals.  He just couldn't afford to leave me out of the team."
  But goals were not the only reason Docherty would not dare to drop Soper.
 Since he joined Olympic three and a half seasons ago Soper has been elevated
to a God-like status by the club's fanatical Greek fans.
  He scores goals, he wins matches and he responds to their adulation. It
would take a brave, if not doomed, coach to take chances with The Man Who
Can Do No Wrong.                            
  "I have a great relationship with the Olympic fans," he said.
  "If I keep scoring goals like I have been, then they respond. When a couple
of thousand people start cheering my name it lifts my performance; it spurs
me on.  And I always like to entertain the crowd, to be a bit of a character.
  "I'm also a cheeky sort of player.  I like to get the ball wide and take
on defenders.  Some people reckon I've got a short fuse, but even in the
middle of an incident I've got a cool head underneath.  I know what I'm
doing because most of the time I've been baiting the defender.  
  "You've got to be confident in this game.  And I reckon I'm one of the
best.  That's why I never worry about the opposition; never respect too many
players.  I let them worry about me." 
  THAT Soper is blossoming into the well-finished article is also a compliment
to Schaefer.  He is the only coach since his mentor of his junior days,
former Everton forward, Mike Trebilcock, to gain his respect.
  "I guess I can be a difficult player to manage, but with Manfred there
have been no problems at all," he said.
  "The only way I can describe it is that we have a bond; that we just seem
to hit it off."  
  Whether the successful relationship keeps Soper at Olympic
until the end of his playing days is debatable.  Although the player enjoys
the club, and would love nothing more than to win the title with Olympic,
he is by nature nomadic.
  "I'm happy with Olympic, but there comes a stage when a player should
move on,"  he said.
  "Call it boredom, but sometimes you need a change to rekindle your
enthusiasm."
  Where he will go after he completes his current one-year contract is anyone's
guess, but there will be no shortage of offers.
  And whether he plays for Olympic next season, or another Australian club,
is immaterial to Arok. If he is going to forgive and forget a second time
then all that matters is that Soper is close at hand.

<bl> IAN MANNING </bl>

<misc> MELBOURNE: </misc>

Les Theodore was fortunate to have been born a gambler, the type
of do-or-die gambler who backs an opinion to the hilt.
  Theodore, 37, is making a big name for himself these days as the trainer
of the outstanding three-year-old Campaign King, but the road to success
from the NSW border town of Berrigan has not always been smooth.
  In fact, if Theodore had not been prepared to gamble he would probably
have been at home in Berrigan yesterday instead of being in Melbourne to
win Saturday's $151,000 Newmarket Handicap with Campaign King.
  "I'm a punter," he said, resting on the bar at his Melbourne motel. 
  "I've been betting since I was 15 - the dogs, the trots, the horses,
anything.  It was something that came naturally at an early age.  And, given
the chance, I wouldn't change a thing."
  Not surprisingly.  One of Theodore's biggest gambles was the purchase
of Campaign King for $12,000 as a two-year-old.
  The tough-as-teak colt has now won 11 of his 15 starts for more than $200,000
in prize money.
  Even the most fearless of punters would applaud Theodore's courage in
purchasing Campaign King.  He outlaid just about everything on a young colt
with only a maiden win at Berrigan under his girth.  
  "I had leased Campaign King from a bloke in Melbourne and would have been
happy to keep it that way," he said.  "But after his first win I knew he
was going to be something special.
  "I rang the owner and said I wanted to buy the colt and he said I could
have him for $15,000, which I thought was a bit steep considering the horse
had won at Berrigan, not Flemington.

 <h> Kuwaiti envoy forced down in USSR: Iran </h>

<misc> KUWAIT, Thursday (Reuter). </misc>

An aircraft taking a special envoy of the Emir of Kuwait to Tehran was chased
last night in Iranian airspace by Iraqi fighters and had to make a forced
landing in the Soviet Union, the Iranian news agency IRNA reported.
  The envoy, former Kuwaiti Oil Minister Mr Abdul Rahman Salem al-Atiqi,
58, was carrying an invitation to the Iranian President, Mr Ali Khamenei,
to attend an Islamic summit meeting in Kuwait in January.
  The aircraft made an emergency landing at the airport at Yerevan, the
capital of Soviet Armenia, according to the office of the Emir of Kuwait,
Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah.
  Kuwait said it had ordered the envoy to return home.  The brief statement,
carried by the Kuwaiti news agency Kuna and broadcast on state-run Kuwait
Television, said the pilot had been instructed to fly back to Kuwait.
  But there was no immediate confirmation in the Soviet Union that the aircraft
had landed there and Western analysts said the Soviet official media were
unlikely to comment until Iran, Iraq and Kuwait had made statements.
  Nor did Iraq make any comment on the allegation by Iran.  The Gulf war
between the two neighbouring countries is now in its seventh year.
  The Kuwaiti statement did not suggest a reason for the plane being diverted
by Iraqi fighters.  It said the aircraft had made a safe landing.
  IRNA said the aircraft had been trailed by Iraqi planes over north-western
Iran, forcing it to change route and enter Soviet air space.  Mr Al-Atiqi
had already visited Jordan, Iraq and Syria to deliver invitations to the
summit meeting.
  Last  Saturday Kuwait fired two missiles at an intruder and Kuwaiti
newspapers said it was an "enemy plane", which was believed to have been
shot down off the Kuwaiti coast.  No wreckage was found.
  Iranian officials hinted that it was a warplane belonging to Iraq, which
has obtained billions of dollars in aid from Kuwait and fellow Gulf Arab
states during its war against Iran.
  Iraq has declared Iranian air space a "forbidden zone".

<h> TERROR BOMBINGS </h>

 <h> French doubts on Syria </h>

<misc> PARIS, Thursday (AFP). -</misc>

France is convinced of the culpability of a Lebanese family in a wave of
Paris terror bombings last month which killed 10 people, but it remains
sceptical of any Syrian involvement, the French Minister for Interior, Mr
Charles Pasqua, said today in Paris.
  In a radio interview, Mr Pasqua said police were "entirely convinced of
the culpability of the Abdallah clan", brothers of Georges Ibrahim Abdallah,
the jailed presumed leader of the Lebanese Armed Revolutionary factions,
in attacks in Paris in September which left 10 dead and 162 wounded.
  Mr Pasqua said the French Government had no proof of Syrian involvement
in the Paris bombs, although this was not to give Syria a totally "clean
bill of health".
  He stressed that the conservative Government refused "to negotiate with
terrorists" and was committed to bringing them to justice.
  But he refused to comment on an article in yesterday's Le Monde claiming
that the Government had used Syrian and Algerian intermediaries to arrange
a four-month truce with the Abdallah clan on the understanding that a
scheduled February court hearing against Georges Abdallah could go in his
favour.
  The Minister's remarks came four days after France, along with other European
Economic Community countries, failed to endorse a British call at an EEC
foreign minister's meeting for tough diplomatic and other sanctions against
Syria.
  Yesterday, however, France announced it had frozen arms sales to Syria,
in response to the British call for measures against that country.

<h> Colonel defects to the rebels </h>

<misc> ISLAMABAD, Thursday (Reuter). </misc>

 - A senior Afghan army officer said yesterday
he had defected to the anti-government Moslem rebels two weeks ago, and
painted a grim picture of the deteriorating military situation inside the
country.
  Colonel Mir Hashmatullah, 43, deputy commander of a division stationed
between Kabul and the border with Pakistan, told a news conference in
Islamabad that he had become a convinced anticommunist since the Soviet
military intervention in 1979.
  Colonel Hashmatullah, who reached Pakistan with his wife and three children
a few days ago, said he had joined the radical Moslem Hezb-e-Islami group,
one of the main guerrilla organisations fighting the Soviet-backed Government
in Kabul.
  Referring to the state of the Afghan army, he told reporters the men did
not want to fight the rebels, relations with the Soviet forces in the country
were poor and the military situation was deteriorating.
  Colonel Hashmatullah's defection, 13 days ago, was followed a week later
by that of an Afghan air force pilot who flew his Soviet-built Mig-21 jet
fighter across the border to Pakistan.
  A Pakistani Foreign Ministry spokesman said yesterday that the aircraft
would be kept in Pakistan until the end of the "civil war" in Afghanistan,
following standard international practice.  Kabul had not requested its
return.  The spokesman said the pilot, identified by Afghan exiles as
Lieutenant Mohammad Daud, would be given political asylum.

 - Six Indians, five of them government officials
were sentenced yesterday in New Delhi to three years' jail after being
convicted of selling classified information to the United States.
  The sentence climaxed a nine-year in-camera trial over charges that the
six men had been selling secret government documents to US Embassy officials
here since 1962.
  Documents included "sensitive Defence Ministry reports, monthly reports
of the foreign ministry, the petroleum ministry and the chemicals department,
according to the prosecution.
  The six men convicted included a consultant engineer Mr P.E. Mehta, and
Mr K.K. Sareen and Mr R.P. Varshney, both directors in India's Planing

 <h> Archbishop defends opposition to Murphy service </h>

<bl> By Graham Downie </bl>

  The Roman Catholic Archbishop of Canberra and Goulburn, the Most Reverend
Francis Carroll, admitted yesterday to being a "very unpopular gentleman"
because of his refusal to allow St Christopher's Cathedral to be used for
a public service for Justice Lionel Murphy.
  Archbishop Carroll said he had no objection to yesterday's thanksgiving
service for Justice Murphy at St Bede's Red Hill, but had strongly opposed
the use of St Christopher's.
  It would be almost an imposition on Lionel Murphy to inflict upon him
something that he never asked for in life," the Archbishop said.
  He had had no objection to a private request for a service of prayers
for Justice Murphy and his family, but had objected to a highly organised
service in which he had been expected to take part but had not been told
about.  He had also objected to any public advertisement of yesterday's
service.
  The church had previously been accused of body-snatching.  "I really felt
that he had the opportunity to ask for the church's ministry while alive,"
he said.  "Therefore it should not be either foisted on him or even given
to him when he is dead."
  Any person (even if baptised a Catholic, as Justice Murphy had been) who
had publicly repudiated a faith, could not "in conscience" be given a Christian
burial.  Not only would this be bad theology, it would have a certain         
impertinence about it.  
  Archbishop Carroll was asked if he had been unpopular with Justice Murphy's
family.  "Oh no, that was one of my problems," he replied.  "I wasn't dealing
with family... A fairly politically-minded person made the approach."
  Had a service at St Christopher's been advertised, the cathedral would
almost certainly have been filled, but he had not wanted the church to
be used for other purposes.
  He had not wanted a faith celebration for a man who had clearly repudiated
that faith, but was also concerned that the service would have been manipulated
and used for unworthy and political reasons.

 <h> A friend vents his anger in church </h>

<bl> By TERESA MANNIX </bl>

  A fiery Irish priest, Father Joseph Staunton, vented his anger against
the media from the pulpit.  In one of the pews sat Mrs Ingrid and Mr Bill
Murphy - the widow and brother of the man who was the subject of yesterday's
Thanksgiving Mass.
  The tiny St Bede's Church in Red Hill, where Father Staunton is a parish
priest, was chosen for the service because an application to hold it at
the more formidable St Christopher's Cathedral at Manuka was turned down.
  Father Staunton told the congregation that a friendship had developed
between himself and Mr Justice Murphy, based on many long arguments.
  Justice Murphy was not a practising Catholic.  The service was held at
Mrs Murphy's request partly because Father Staunton had spent so much time
with her husband towards the end of his life, and partly because those who
had been close to the judge wanted to give thanks for his life rather than
to mourn his memory.
  The Member for Canberra, Mrs Kelly, attended, as did the Member for Fraser,
Mr Langmore.  There was a smattering of diplomats among the 70 or so people
but it was, generally, a very subdued affair.
  Children from St Bede's Primary School sang the hymns.  There was no
pomp and little ceremony.
  Father Staunton delivered his political sermon from the pulpit.  He told
the congregation repeatedly that he hoped that nobody in Australia would
ever again be subjected to a campaign of vilification like that directed
against Justice Murphy.
  Even the word "allegation", used by some sections of the media, was
a "despicable assumption".
  He said Justice Murphy had suffered the pain of the accusations almost
to the very end of his life.  Every new inquiry against him produced further
"agony". 
  The congregation filed out quietly at the end of the service.  Mrs Murphy
even raised a smile outside as she was hugged by sympathisers before climbing
into a waiting diplomatic car.

 <h> Yass Shire to review safety of old dam </h>

<bl> By Teresa Mannix </bl>

  Yass Shire Council has decided to reverse an earlier decision and proceed
with a safety review of Yass River Dam, as recommended by the NSW Dam Safety
Committee.
  The shire engineer, Mr Bert Kaub, said yesterday that the council had adopted
his recommendation that specifications be sought from the committee and
a costing obtained for the review.
  The decision was prompted by the committee's fears that the dam could
burst, causing loss of life and property.
  The 60-year-old dam was built when there was inadequate knowledge of
likely floods and rainfall levels.
  According to the committee, two floods had already subjected the dam to
its maximum stress levels, and larger floods could be expected.
  The council previously rejected Mr Kaub's recommendation that the safety
review be carried out.
  He said the specifications would include such matters as the likely size
of future floods, whether the structure would hold under such stresses,
the waterproofing of the dam, the condition of the concrete and the general
safety of the structure under adverse conditions.

 <h> Buildings to be used for education </h>

  Buildings at Watson High School are likely to continue to be used for
educational purposes after the school's closure at the end of next year.
  The Minister for Education, Senator Ryan, said in a statement yesterday
that the school was "valuable public property" and that it was "desirable
that it continues to provide some form of educational service".
  Senator Ryan did not detail what the school could be used for but said
it would be decided after talks with the ACT Teachers' Federation and other
interested parties.
  The president of the federation, Mr Peter O'Connor, said yesterday that
it was "encouraging" that Senator Ryan wanted the buildings used for
educational purposes.

 <h> The PNG `big man' whom time passed by </h>

<bl> By a special correspondent </bl>

<misc> Port Moresby, 17 Nov - </misc>

`Action Man' is dead.  He failed in life, to fulfil his most desperate
ambition, to become Papua New Guinea's first Highland Prime Minister.  But
in death he has certainly made his mark on his country.
  Sir Iambakey Okuk, who was mourned yesterday with riots and the isolation
of the nation's capital, was a truly pugnacious son of the Highlands.
  Born 43 years ago in Pari village, Chimbu province, Sir Iambakey left
high school after three years and served an apprenticeship as a motor
mechanic.  He first stood for Parliament in the 1968 election, for the
Mount Hagen constituency where he was then working.  He came fourth.
 Despite the immense wave of Highland anguish over his premature death,
of liver cancer, he never achieved an overwhelming electoral response.
 He won an election back home in Chimbu in 1972, as a member of Sir Thomas
Kavali's National Party, which he soon took over.
  In 1977 he won again, securing the highest proportional vote of his career
- 22 per cent, still enough to secure victory in a first-past-the-post system.
  Sir Iambakey was unpredictable, ruthlessly ambitious, belligerent, and
had a surprising capacity to charm.
  His place in history will come (if for anything apart from his riotous
funeral) from his unselfconscious early stance for independence, opposing
the conservative Highlands trend which had seen most "big men" support the
planters'-based United Party for fear of being dominated by the better
educated coastal people.
  He was considered bolshie by the European establishment - and behaved
in manner to suit, especially when, after helping tip the delicate balance
after the 1972 election in Michael Somare's way, he was rewarded with the
transport portfolio.
  He did not last long, upsetting Cabinet solidarity too often and overturning
too many agreed policies.  He joined the Opposition, vowing to get his
ministry back, on his own terms.
  To achieve this, he moved obsessively*obssessively for the jugular of 
old-time United Party leader Sir Tei Abal, who felt the Opposition's role 
at that time of independence should be to rally round the Government.
  It did not take Sir Iambakey long after the 1977 election to become leader
of the Opposition and he sought his next victim:  Mr Somare.
  After two failed no-confidence attempts, though, he was enough of a realist
to concede that another Opposition politician might stand a better chance
and supported Sir Julius Chan's winning push to become Prime Minister in
March 1980.  Sir Iambakey became deputy Prime Minister.
  Paias Wingti's achievement of becoming, aged only 34, the first Highland
Prime Minister must have particlarly upset Sir Iambakey, though he never
referred to it publicly. 
  Time, in a sense, had already passed by his particularly*particuarly 
colorful brand of regionally based Highlands "big man" leadership. People 
were looking now for more sophistication, education and even consultation.  
But for many Highlanders he remained a symbol of their energetic and vibrant 
culture, the "Action Man" they now mourn.

<h> Aquino readies for war with rebels </h>

<bl> By MARK FINEMAN of the `Los Angeles Times' </bl>

<misc> Manila, 17 Nov. - </misc>

The President of the Philippines, Corazon Aquino, declared yesterday that
she was "ready to lead the war" against the communist insurgency, as her
Government prepared to abandon efforts to negotiate a nationwide ceasefire
with leaders of the 17-year rebellion.
  A cabinet source said that the Government's two chief negotiators told
the President that their four months of peace talks with the rebels were
at a hopeless impasse, and they recommended that the time had come for
Mrs Aquino to pick up what she has called "the sword of war".
  At the same time, several military commanders said that the Philippines
armed forces had launched several regional offensives in the past week
aimed at strengthening the Government's position against the 23,000 armed
insurgents - either as a prelude to a ceasefire or as a contingency in
case the peace talks fail.
  Speaking at a world peace rally yesterday morning, Mrs Aquino said that
she still hoped that her negotiators could find a political solution to
the conflict, but her readiness to go to war came as the negotiators began
urging her to give up her national peace effort.
  They recommended that instead she pursue regional ceasefires with the
communists, while simultaneously turning loose her 200,000-strong military
forces in selected provinces where the insurgency has made its greatest
gains.
  The recommendation came after the rebels' political front group cancelled
a scheduled negotiating session with the Government on Friday.
  The National Democratic Front said the cancellation was triggered by
last week's ganglandstyle killing of a labor leader, Rolando Olalia, whose
union has been labelled a communist front by military leaders.
  Tension in Manila deepened at the weekend after the regional director
of Japan's third-largest corporation was kidnapped by five armed men while
driving home from a round of golf at a suburban country club.
  The Government released no details on the kidnapping, which was widely
viewed as a personal embarrassment for Mrs Aquino, who returned from a four-day
state visit to Japan 48 hours earlier.  She had guaranteed the Japanese
that her Government was stable and urged them to provide foreign aid and
investment to help the Philippines out of its worst economic crisis since
World War II.
  The murder, the kidnapping and the ensuing insecurity in the capital has
polarised the political forces of the left and right in Mrs Aquino's coalition
Government and presented her with what analysts call potentially the most
explosive crisis she has faced since assuming office last February.
  At Mr Olalia's wake on Friday night, a rebel negotiator, Satur Ocampo,
told reporters that the communist leadership was still willing to continue
the national ceasefire negotiations, and he cautioned Mrs Aquino "not to
fall into the trap" of right-wing elements in her Government who are trying
to "scuttle the ceasefire talks".
  The Defence Minister, Juan Ponce Enrile, has been openly critical of Mrs
Aquino's "path of peace" approach to solving the insurgency, a policy she
has said is needed to give her "the moral basis" to continue the war. 
The Defence Minister has called the peace talks "negotiations for war".
  The Government negotiators - both past advocates of peace -  are said
to be exhausted and frustrated by the negotiating sessions, which they
must attend without personal security and at secret locations chosen by
the rebels.
  The negotiators are now convinced that the rebels are merely trying
to manipulate the Government through the talks, sources said.

 <h> Manila's protest strike fizzles out </h>

<misc> Manila, 17 Nov  </misc>

- A general strike called to paralyse Manila in protest at
the killing of a trade union leader flopped today while officials first
announced, then retracted news that a man had been arrested in connection
with the murder.
  The Justice Minister, Neptali Gonzales, who had claimed there was an arrest
in the case, said later that informers had given police the names of two
men who stalked Rolando Olalia in the days before his death.
  Police were now seeking the men to put them in an identification parade,
he said.
  Mr Gonzales said that a car seen in Mr Olalia's neighbourhood shortly before
the kidnap had a licence plate that could have been issued to a Government
agency.
  A general strike called by Mr Olalia's 500,000-member May First Movement
interfered with bus services and led to walkouts by 30,000 workers at 120
factories - far from the numbers strike leaders had predicted.
  Manila officials suspended all classes for the city's schoolchildren
and a police spokesman said the city was calm and orderly.
  While many bus drivers appeared to be obeying the strike call, 300 of
the city's 500 buses were in operation.  Many of these were driven by soldiers
with police protection, officals said.
  The auditor's office of the Pasay City government in southern Manila
caught fire after a bomb was hurled through a window from a car.
  Police said the bombers must have wanted to destroy important documents.

 - The home of the Kanak leader, Mr Uieiwene Uieiwene, president
of the three Loyalty Islands off New Caledonia, was attacked last night.
  Three men are reported to have fired shots at his home and to have tried
to burn it down.  Mr Uieiwene is in Paris with the two other pro-independence
leaders to meet French officials.
  Mr Uieiwene's wife and three children were believed to be in the house
at the time of the attack.  Guards posted at the house in case of trouble
drove off the attackers.
  The Noumea printing works of the `Bwenando' newspaper was destroyed by
fire last night.  The newspaper is the organ of the proindependence Kanak
coalition.
  The atmosphere was calm in the city today but trouble is expected tomorrow
with the funeral of the 14-year-old boy shot dead in clashes between pro

<h> Puzzle as North Korean leader is reported dead </h>

Radio Pyongyang's broadcasts remained normal, with programs on the President's
recent visit to Moscow and upbeat music.
  If the rumor is true, sources say a power struggle might be in train and
this would explain the radio's silence on the issue.
 Officials in Seoul said South Korean national police had been on full alert
since yesterday because of "unusual North Korean movements and for fear
of any machinations by impure elements at home and abroad".  Seoul calls
pro-communist radicals in the south "impure elements".
  A Western diplomat travelling north of Seoul in the afternoon reported
seeing columns of combat-ready troops pouring north towards the demilitarised
zone (DMZ), which is only about 40 kilometres from Seoul.
  The Defence Ministry made no further comments after this morning's
announcement, but Seoul newspapers, quoting ministry sources, reported
this evening that two broadcast towers along the DMZ first broadcast the
report of Mr Kim's death.
  One report said the broadcast, beamed towards the south along the heavily
fortified zone, gave the news that he had been shot in a train.
  Officials of the United Nations Command said they had heard no such
broadcasts in the Panmunjom area of the DMZ which is policed jointly by
UN and South Korean troops.

 <h> Plan to cut airport fire services criticised </h>

<bl> By TONY HARRINGTON, transport reporter </bl>

Pilot training by East-West Airlines could be seriously affected if the
Department of Aviation closes the airport fire service at Tamworth in New
South Wales.
  East-West trains up to 300 pilots each year at Tamworth, its home base.
 The Australian Federation of Air Pilots does not allow flying training
at airports which have no fire cover.
  The department wants to close airport fire stations at Tamworth, Norfolk
Island and Proserpine, in north Queensland, because the number of passengers
on scheduled flights has fallen below 150,000 a year, the base figure for
fire cover.                                       
  Airlines also are required to pay for "after hours" fire cover at Sydney,
Brisbane, Adelaide, Hobart, Launceston and Mount Isa airports as part of
the department's cost recovery program.
  The Federal Firefighters Union and the Australian Flight Attendants
Association have also criticised the decision to close the fire stations.
  Both unions claimed that the Department of Aviation used 1984 passenger
figures to justify decisions to close the three airport fire services.
  They have written to the department, the Government and other politicians
urging a review of the decision.

<misc>...is not an easy one.  In part two of a series on housework, Louise Carbines
looks at a day in the life of a full-time housewife and mother.  And inside,
the `stronger sex' reflects on the domestic front. </misc>

ANNE Lloyd Mackenzie belongs to a diminishing species, the stay-at-home
mother.  In Australia nowadays, only a third of children are looked after
at home by their mothers.  Anne is an advocate for a minority committed
to a lifestyle which traditionally has been regarded as an honorable fate.
  For Anne, being a mother is synonymous with being a teacher.  At home,
she looks after her son Cameron, 3, and 16-month-old twins Rob and Cathy.
 Her job is of inestimable value. If she were paid for her professional
training as a teacher, she would earn about $450 a week.
  She is sad that society pigeonholes motherhood as an important but
low-status job because the going rate for mothers is nothing.  A live-in
housekeeper could command about $400 a week.  A live-in nanny would cost
about $175 a week.  Even domestic help costs about $9 an hour.
  "I'm sure that pay would raise society's regard for mothers," she says.
 "I'd like to see people at home being paid a living wage and people at
work being taxed more heavily.  There's a lack of community responsibility
for families. I also really like the idea of a communal village, where people
could share responsibility for child care."
  At 6.30 am, Anne's reasons for staying at home have already woken up.
Dummy in her mouth, hair standing on end, Cathy waddles into the kitchen.
She rounds the table, teeters, then makes for her mother's navy dressing gown.
Safely behind it, she takes a wary interest in the strangers who have 
inexplicably appeared.
  Rob, her twin brother, arrives a few minutes later, trailing the bedclothes
behind him.  Barefoot, he plods up to the table, his brown security-blanket
sweeping the floor.  Often, he will thoughtfully bring Cathy a blanket
and lend her his dummy.  There is more love than rivalry between them. 
His father, Ian, swings him up into a high-chair, settling him in front
of breakfast. Soon, Rob's face is covered with Vegemite and the table with
milk and Weeties.
  Ian usually feeds the children breakfast.  He is often on call as a doctor,
but Anne is always on call as a mother.  If she is lucky, this family routine
lets her sleep until 7am.  But today she is up for the children's breakfast,
prepared to welcome us early so that we can spend a day with her at home.
  "If you come that early, you'll probably find me in my dressing gown,"
she had joked the day before.  The dressing gown, like hair-rollers, is
part of the caricature of the housewife, almost a symbol of a dull or dilatory
life.  If she is not dressed up she is not doing much, or she is doing a
lot of little consequence.  Good humoredly, Anne wears her dressing gown,
reads the paper and makes tea for her guests at the beginning of a long day.
Meanwhile, her children are turning the kitchen into a playroom.
  "Robert, you will go head over toes," she says, watching him pull cake-tins
and a bread-board out of a cupboard.  He jumps up and down on them and grins.
Cathy joins him.  They bump into each other and fall on their bottoms.  "See,"
their mother laughs.  "That's what you get for mucking around."
  Next, they help her with the dishes.  They push their chairs over to the
sink and wait for her to roll up their sleeves.  While an adult sees the
dishes, a child sees the bubbles.  They pat the bubbles, and fish for the
sponge in the sink.  Julius Sumner Miller would be proud of their wonder
and application as they squeeze water on to the bench and mop it up.
  "I always think of it as a learning experience," Anne says, as she helps
her slow dishwashers down from their chairs. "It's important to provide
them with an environment where they can explore."  At the moment, chores
are a game for them.  For Anne, they are the consequence rather than the
purpose of staying at home.
  "People might not believe it, but I do like to have the house tidy.  However,
I think this is more important.
  "When I was teaching, I often felt that I was fixing up other people's
mistakes.  I try to use a lot of the techniques that I used when I was
teaching.  Being education-oriented, I try to preserve their curiosity.
So many children seemed to have the curiosity barked out of them with
`Don't do that!'."
  Cam scooted into the kitchen.  He had told Anne that he didn't mind if
a photographer came to see him, but he didn't want to meet a reporter.
He met Sebbie, the photographer, who showed him his cameras.  "Anne, what's
a journalist?" he asked, as he sat down for breakfast.  The explanation
did not excite him.
  "What are you eating?" I asked, making small-talk.
  "I was going to eat toast, but the babies finished it off."  Despite this,
he got on well with his babies, and had asked Anne if she would have "just
one more lot".
  While Cam and Sebbie discussed the logistics of eating jellybeans on
toast, Anne talked about her children. "Cam is very verbal.  He tends to
have passionate friendships with little girls he knows.  When he was young,
he would never let me leave him. I don't know how much of that was fear
from asthma.  He was admitted to hospital with asthma at 12 months."  This
morning, she would need to give him two air-pumps for his asthma. 
  "Cathy really likes to play to a gallery.  But Rob is really affectionate
to people he knows.  He's very orderly.  He likes everything in its place."
  Wiping the sink, Anne thought carefully about her definition of a "good
mother".  She was very conscious of how exacting society could be of the
women it did not pay.  "I think that being a good mother is something to
do with letting children's personalities emerge to make the child a happy
person.  It's important to nurture their personalities so that they also
come to terms with the faults in their characters.  Being a good mother
is about civilising and socialising children.
  "The most exciting thing is just watching their personalities develop,
to see that these inquiring little persons are learning from the way that
you have treated them.  You put so much work into them before they can speak
and walk and it's not until they are three of four that you can see the
results.  
  "I think that being a mother is also very sensuous.  You're always being
touched and cuddled. You enjoy that intimacy."
  Anne, 31, had been brought up by a mother at home.  This had influenced
her decision to stay at home.  She wanted to be able to answer her children's
"whys", even though, sometimes, they seemed like just more of the interminable
demands made on mothers.  "I'm sure that someone who is just doing a job
would not have the same commitment to answering their questions."  She
was sure that mothers were also the best decoders of their children's early
speech, helping them make sentences from phrases, and phrases from words.
  "Sebbie?  Will you come and watch `Playschool' with me?" Cam asks.  It
is 9 am, and he and Sebbie disappear into the front room.  Already, Anne
has dressed her three children, hung a load of washing on the clothesline
and stopped to play with the trio on the jungle gym which, according to
Cam, offered the best view of Halley's comet in the back yard.
  "Television really gives Cam a lot of ideas for things to do.  But the
standard really varies.  I did use it a lot as a baby-sitter. I suppose
I would think it was bad if Cam watched `Sesame Street' and `Playschool'
twice a day.  That would mean that he was watching three hours of television
a day."
  In the front room, Cam is leaning over the arm of a couch pushed close
to the television.  It is the best room in their house.  "Sometimes people
tell me to keep him out of the front room, that we should have a room that
won't be damaged by the children.  I think that he should grow up in a house
that belongs to him.  It teaches him that he has responsibilities and
rights.  You can't do that if you're trying to keep the place tidy all the
time." 
  Anne and Ian bought their house in an eastern suburb about five years ago.
Anne says her house would never feature in `Home Beautiful', and she would
never fit the advertisers' ideal of the "margarine mum". One day, she says,
they will get around to doing all the painting and the weeding which a
margarine mum would have done.
  "I think that our spending priorities are quite atypical.  We spend very
little on clothes or the house.  The rest goes on help.  I think that money
is a real problem for many people with young families.  I'm very lucky.
I have someone who comes in at tea for two hours.  We agreed that I should
have help in lieu of the time that Ian couldn't give me.  
  "We decided that Ian should go on to further study.  I suppose that I
lose seniority, but I don't lose my position.  I'd much rather see careers
compromised than the children compromised.  I think that a lot of people
would like to do more with their families, but careers just aren't structured
that way."
  She resents the times when people dismissed her because of her job.
They seemed to think that women at home lacked ambition or intelligence because
they were "just housewives".
  Sometimes she feels trapped.  "There are times when I'd just like to go
down to the library and get some books, but often you can't do that on the
spur of the moment."  She also regretted that becoming a parent meant that
she and Ian spent less time with friends who did not have children.  "We've
really lost touch with a lot of people, a lot of friends.  You tend to go
and see people with children.  Usually we're headed to bed by 9.30pm."
  Last night, they had gone to bed about 11. Cathy woke at about 2am, and
Cam could not sleep because of his asthma.  The children finally settled
down at about 4am.  Everyone was up a couple of hours later.  "I suppose
lack of sleep is the worst thing about motherhood," Anne says.  "You can
put up with almost anything else."
  By 11 am, the twins are waddling around with their blankets, a sign that
they are ready for a sleep.  After hanging out another load of washing, making
the beds and giving Cam an air-pump, Anne picks up Cathy and Cam and reads
them stories in the back yard.  She reads `Elizabeth Anne' and `Amazing Trains
of the World'.  We learn that people in India like to travel on top of
trains as well as inside them.
  Under the clothesline, Cam climbs into a bus which, until a few minutes
ago, had been the family banana chair.  "I can see London Bridge," he shouts.
 Naturally, he is the driver, and Sebbie is the porter who must load and
unload the bus.  There is a lot of luggage; a wheelbarrow, a mop, a bucket,
a rake, a kickboard and the babies' bath.
  Luckily for the porter, the bus driver has to go to kinder at 1pm.  He
rides his bicycle to kinder, ahead of the babies (in their stroller), Anne,
Sebbie and the journalist.  Before she picks him up at 3 pm, Anne goes home
again, does the lunch dishes and takes the twins shopping.  She buys them
a broom and umbrellas, blue and red.  Sweeping the footpath and testing
their umbrellas, the family arrives home again at 4pm.

<h> Crocodile incident marks second time round for Alf </h>

<misc> BRISBANE </misc>

- A Proserpine man mauled on Sunday by a 2 metre "pet" 
crocodile had heroically saved his younger brother from a croc 
attack in a boyhood drama.
  Mr Alf Casey, 69, of O'Connell River, is recovering in the 
Mackay Hospital.
  Doctors removed his right arm to the elbow after the mauling by 
the 100kg croc, "Charlene", which Mr Casey had looked after for 
24 years.
  Charlene was given to the family by a professional*profesional hunter and 
the bond between it and Mr Casey was so strong that he had often 
taken it to the local pub with him.
  Mr Casey has urged wildlife officers not to destroy the croc, 
which was yesterday freighted to Townsville after it turned on 
him as he fed it in a backyard enclosure.
  He poked the croc in the eyes in a desperate attempt to escape. 
  His wife, Mrs Rae Casey, 63, said that as a boy, Mr  Casey had 
dragged his brother out of the O'Connell River seconds before a 
4m croc was about to attack.
  Mrs Casey said Alf had grown up with crocodiles, with the 
reptiles swimming to a waterhole off the river only 150m from his 
house.
  She said Mr Casey had tried raising other crocs before 
Charlene, but none survived.
  "Alf would not want Charlene shot.  He is very preservation-
minded," Mrs Casey said.
  Mrs Casey said her husband, "a strong healthy man", had lost 
three fingers on his left hand in a chainsaw accident two years 
ago.
  Mr Ed Casey (ALP, Mackay) said today he had known the Casey 
family for many years and Alf's relationship with Charlene was 
a talking point in the north.
  "The croc would travel with Alf wherever he went.  He would 
throw the croc in a back of his utility and often would walk down 
the street with the croc on a leash," Mr Casey said.

 <h> Ex-wife pays the price of divorce </h>

<bl> By PATRICIA MORGAN </bl>

<misc> LONDON, Tues  </misc>

- Elizabeth Browne, former wife of a Tory MP, went 
to court today with her bags packed for a spell in jail - for 
failing to pay maintenance to her ex-husband.
  Outside the court she said: "I just cannot believe he can do 
this to me.  He knows I have no more money."
  She owes her ex-husband $350,000 in a divorce pay-off.
  Mrs Browne is the former wife of finance company chief and ex-
Guards officer John Browne, Tory MP for Winchester.
  She was awarded a divorce in 1984 on the grounds of Browne's 
adultery.  But a judge ruled she must pay the lump-sum 
maintenance, based on her assets.
  In August she was given a 28-day jail sentence on condition she 
completed the pay-off.  She has so far paid $248,000 but still 
owes $350,000. 
  There was no hearing today, so Mrs Browne returned home to 
Chelsea.  But Mr Browne's lawyers are planning new legal moves 
and she may still end up in jail this week.
  "I've paid over every penny I can raise, there is no more," she 
said.

 <h> Queensland's FBT bid opens in High Court </h>

<bl> From ROSS McSWAIN </bl>

<misc> CANBERRA </misc>

- The Queensland Government's constitutional challenge 
to the fringe benefits tax started in the High Court today.
  The challenge is based on Section 114 of the Constitution 
which stops the Commonwealth taxing any property belonging to a 
state and any state taxing property belonging to the 
Commonwealth.
  The Queensland challenge is the first against the FBT.
  But a second challenge has been lodged by the NSW Chamber of 
Commerce.
  The Chamber of Commerce challenge, also to be heard in the 
High Court, is the first by a business group.
  Their opposition will be based on a separate section of the 
Constitution which deals with taxation laws and how they 
relate to certain taxes.
  The Queensland Cabinet decided to go ahead with the 
constitutional challenge after it received a full briefing on 
July 28.
  The Federal Government has since made changes to the tax to 
eliminate "unintended consequences".
  The changes are expected to cost the Government a least $75 
million in lost revenue.

 <h> Arthur discharges broadside at White </h>

<bl> By Sandra Lee </bl>

After a week in hospital, 19-year-old Arthur Ainalis was 
sympathetic to the nurses' strike.
  As he left Western General Hospital yesterday afternoon, all 
Arthur wanted to do was to get a message to the Health Minister, 
Mr White, and say goodbye to his new nursing friend.
  He was injured in a car accident last Tuesday week, and was 
admitted the next day.
  Mr Ainalis was one of the patients discharged as the hospital 
geared up for the full-scale strike today.
  When he left, he couldn't find the nurse, but was still 
intent on getting a message to the Minister.
  "Mr White should come here and work for a couple of weeks and 
then maybe he will change his mind," Mr Ainalis said.
  "The nurses are all right.
  "Even though they are on strike they still looked after us and 
they have worked really hard to help everybody.
  "I feel really sorry for them.
  "They are always running around doing this and doing that, and 
from what I've seen and heard I think they deserve more pay.
  "They are trying to do their best and I hope they get what they 
want out of the strike."
  His mother, Ritsa, believed the nurses had a point in their 
strike, but was also concerned for the sick patients having to 
leave the hospital earlier than planned.
  Mrs Ainalis said the nurses had worked extremely hard over the 
past few days and were at patients' sides as soon as they were 
called.
  About 100 patients left the hospital yesterday, but the 
critically ill and those who were unable to be moved stayed.

 <h> Grand jury's historic role: judge </h>

Victoria's first grand jury in 46 years was today empanelled in 
the Supreme Court to decide if a solicitor should be sent for 
[Atrial on fraud charges.
  Mr Justice O'Bryan told the 17 women and six men comprising the 
grand jury that it was an historic and important event.
  He told them their function was unusual and very different from 
ordinary criminal proceedings.  
  The defendant, John Gerard McArdle, played no part in the 
hearing and was not represented, the judge said.  Neither the 
judge nor any barristers took part.
  The judge said legal tradition meant he had to ask the grand 
jury panel whether any of them were aliens or outlaws.
  Before the court was cleared and became the grand jury chamber, 
the judge spent about two hours explaining the function of the 
grand jury.
  He said their job was not to decide if McArdle was guilty or 
innocent, it was to decide whether or not he should be sent for 
trial.
  Mr Justice O'Bryan said this meant a different standard of 
proof, which was that there was "probable evidence in support of 
an offence".
  It also meant that unlike other juries, only a majority of 
them, that is 12, need be satisfied one way or the other.
  The judge told the grand jury the two charges alleged against 
McArdle were fraudulent conversion under the Crimes Act and 
conspiracy to defraud under common law.
  The judge said the grand jury should ignore anything they had 
read or heard about the procedure.
  "It is not for you or me to decide if the grand jury procedure 
is the most appropriate procedure.  That is for the State 
Parliament."
  The judge said the foreman would have to write on the 
indictments either "true bill" which meant McArdle would be sent 
for trial or "not a true bill."
  The judge said the grand jury deliberations and examination of 
witnesses would be completely secret and any notes they took 
would be shredded later.
  The hearing is not finished.

 <h> Outcry over prices for Brisbane Expo </h>

<misc> BRISBANE </misc>

- The Federal Government will intervene to try to force 
down the price of tickets for Brisbane's World Fair.
  A family of two adults and three children face admission prices 
of $95 a day.
  Expo 88 is due to run from April to October over a massive area 
of Brisbane, centred along the south bank of the Brisbane River.
  Nineteen countries have so far agreed to take part, with 
organisers aiming for about 30.
  The prices, announced yesterday by Expo 88 chairman, Sir Llew 
Edwards provoked an immediate outcry from consumer groups.
  Mr Keith Wright, chairman of the Federal Government's Consumer 
Affairs committee said: "Those prices are unbelievable and it is 
a great pity.
  "I shall write officially to Sir Llew, explaining that the high 
prices will be an early deterrent and will influence people's 
attitudes about Expo.
  "I am sure I can convince him the cost of running Expo can be 
offset by attracting large groups of school pupils and pensioners 
as well as youth organisations.
  "We must do something to get that admission price down."
  Season tickets during the Expo will cost $160 for adults and 
$95 for children and pensioners.
  But the tickets will go on sale soon for $99 and $60, 
increasing in price by up to $15 each three months until April, 
1988.
  Sir Llew said there was a definite incentive to buy season 
tickets early.
  He said research showed people with season tickets were likely 
to visit at least 3 times.
  "This works out at $8.30 a visit for adults and only $5 a visit 
for pensioners and children using their early season tickets, 
said Sir Llew.
  But Mr Wright, the former State Opposition leader who also is 
president of the Queensland Consumers' Association, said that by 
the time inflation gnawed at the season ticket price its 
advantage would be lost.
  Mr Wright said the Expo 88 chairman must explain fully how he 
arrived at the prices.
  "High prices are such a pity because the social and cultural 
impact for many Australians, let alone Queenslanders, will be 
tremendously important."

<h> All's fair in dollar chase </h>

<bl> By MARK HOOPER </bl>

When it comes to international popularity, countries such as Libya, Cuba,
South Africa, Iran, and the Soviet Union can hardly claim to be on the western
world's Christmas card list.
  But popularity and politics count for little and profits count for much
as far as Australia's agricultural traders are concerned.
  In the past year, there have been record wheat sales to the Soviet Union
and strong wheat sales to South Africa.
  Live sheep exports to Libya resumed just last month after a 16-month recess,
and we continue to sell Iran large quantities of wheat and meat.
  And on Monday, Australia's first beef cattle export to Cuba leaves Melbourne.
  The trend is summed up by a standard line from the Australian Wheat
Board:  "We have a responsibility to market our produce wherever we can."
  The Australian-Soviet bond in wheat trade is one of the strongest in the
world and is likely to continue despite raids by Europe and the U.S. this
year.
  Australia sold 3.2 million tonnes of grain to the Soviet Union in the
marketing year just ended and there is every chance the volume will be repeated,
albeit at depressed prices.
  An AWB spokesman said the "excellent" relationship would continue because
the Soviets valued the quality and quality control standards of Australian
wheat. 
  When South Africa is short of wheat, it also relies on Australia.  Despite
the Hawke Government's high-profile anti-apartheid campaign, the AWB shipped
100,000 tonnes of wheat to South Africa this year, worth about $15 million.
  That represented about one-third of South Africa's import needs.  Canada
and the U.S. supplied the rest.  Australia could replace the U.S. as southern
Africa's major supplier if U.S. sanctions extend to wheat.  
  A shipment of 104,000 live sheep from Fremantle bound for Libya last
month represented the first such trade since May last year.
  The Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation says Libya is a developing
market and prospects for future shipments are promising.
  "A contributing factor to the resumption of trade is the attractive price
at which the Australian exporter can supply the sheep," an AMLC spokesman
said.
  The Chernobyl nuclear accident also prompted Libyan authorities to look
to Australia after they banned imports from eastern Europe.
  Iran has bought 4 million tonnes of wheat from Australia in the past
three years, and buys thousands of tonnes of mutton and lamb from us each
year.
  Iran's Agriculture Minister, Mr Abbasali Zali, was recently in Australia
"looking at areas to expand co-operation".
  The Department of Primary Industry described the sale of 670 beef cattle
to Cuba as a breakthrough.  The department said last week Cuban authorities
were also interested in buying Australian buffalo and 1500 head were being
tested in the Northern Territory for their suitability for export to Cuba.
  The department said exporters were hoping the Cuban trade would increase.
 Cuba previously imported most of its cattle from Europe and Canada.

 <h> For Arthur Ellis, it's time to quit </h>

<bl> By Terry Friel </bl>

Leading Melbourne car dealer Arthur Ellis is quitting.
  And he's tipping as many as half of Melbourne's new car dealerships to
disappear within two years.
  The Ellis family Holden and Honda dealership will be auctioned on December
10 - a victim of the fringe benefits tax and the slump which has rocked
the new car market.
  New car registrations plunged almost 20 per cent nationally last month
as the industry continued to slip into its worst position in eight years.
  Mr Ellis said FBT was "the final straw" for his family's six-year-old
Heidelberg operation.
  And he predicted that the widely condemned tax would claim more victims
in the car industry.
  "There is no doubt in the world that anybody who is hovering will fall
(because of the tax)," he said.
  Mr Ellis said the new car market had fallen 25-30 per cent at the same
time interest rates had rocketed 50 per cent.
  The main reasons behind his move were the market slump, FBT and the amount 
of interest expressed in the dealership property.  "We haven't been pushed 
to the wall," he said.
  But Mr Ellis, who has been in the business 35 years, said the outlook
for the new car industry was grim.
  "I feel in the next couple of years it's going to go down," he said.
"Most of the dealers are having a hard time."
  Competition was fierce in the face of falling sales and profit margins
had been slashed.
  Mr Ellis said the Federal Government faced a huge groundswell reaction
against FBT.
  He will take a bus-load of protesters to an anti-FBT rally in the City
Square on Monday.
  Mr Ellis said the Government was cutting its own throat with FBT.  The
impact of the tax on business profitability would cut Government revenue
from other taxes, such as sales tax.
  He said he would help his staff find new jobs.  The industry slump had
already forced the Ellis operation to trim staff.
  Mr Ellis will stay on for a time to "tidy up". He has no definite plans
after that.

 <h> From drought to tourist flood </h>

<bl> By MARK HOOPER </bl>

THE Big Drought of 1982/83 broke the spirit of many people on the land,
but it was also the catalyst for some entrepreneurial spirit.
  Such is the case with Antony and Heather Heath of Bairnsdale.
  The downturn in their sheep grazing and shearing activities during and
after the drought forced them to look at alternative sources of income.
  Selling the farm was out because of the family tradition and their love
of the land.  So they decided to take advantage of one of the few things
not affected by the drought - the main road.
  The Heath's 300 ha property, called Redcourt, borders the Princes Hwy
10 km west of Bairnsdale.
  From their farmhouse near the road, they could see the drought wasn't
stopping hordes of travellers to Lakes Entrance, Mallacoota, the high country
around Omeo and the south coast of NSW. 
  So they jumped on the bandwagon and started a tourist attraction of their
own, the Redcourt Woolshed, designed for city people and overseas travellers.
  The Woolshed provides visitors with a demonstration of shearing, wool
sorting, four different breeds of important Australian sheep, sheep dogs
in action, and a small museum.
  The idea was not new, but it was borne of some desperation during a bleak
period in Australia's rural history.
  And there is a constant flow of tourist coaches, many of them carrying
travellers from overseas, to the Woolshed.
  Mr Heath does the shearing and he clearly revels in the opportunity to
show off the skills and importance of the wool industry.
  "It was a case of us trying to diversify, helping bring the country
and city closer together, and it has worked," Mr Heath said.
  "People can wander around the property and be close to the sheep and the
dogs and what happens on the farm."
  The Heaths' commercial concerns have also picked up over the past few
years and their tourist considerations had to be cancelled last week as
the shearing of Redcourt's 3000 fine wool Merinos was done by a local team.

 <h>1c upon a time, it made sense... </h>

<misc> One cent.  It's not much.  Yet somehow it's even less than it used to be.
 BRUCE EVA took his solitary cent - not to mention high hopes and memories
- to Melbourne's shopkeepers. </misc>

WHAT does the South Melbourne Football Club, the dodo, the Tasmanian tiger 
and the $1 note all have in common?
  Extinction!
  Membership requirements for this exclusive club are very simple.  Don't
exist.
  It is not a popular club by any stretch of the imagination yet away in
the distance we have a new applicant looming.
  The one-cent piece.
  Yes, you remember it, the little copper piece you find lying in the street
that you are too scared to pick up in case someone is watching you. 
  Or the fiddly little thing you receive with your receipt when you have
just bought your first toaster for $49.99
  So the question has been raised.  Do we need the one-cent coin? 
  I mean, how long has it been since one could buy something for a cent,
or going further back, a penny?
  I remember the good old days in primary school, when if you found a one-cent
piece, you had two extra mates during lunchtime.  The reason?  Three jellybeans
for a cent.
  Nowadays for all the big spenders we have the one-cent stamp and for
all you miserly hackers out there chopping up our public and private courses
you can buy a single, plastic, colored golf tee for a cent.
  And if you're hungry while out on the course then you can splurge on a
single lolly for a cent although it might taking some hunting around to
find shops that still sell them.
  Yet someone else must be able to make use of this sometimes meaningless
little thing.
  The government!
  Not buying anything on your Bankcard does not save you from our beloved
money collectors.
  You will still be charged one-cent for something they term Financial
Institutions Duty.  Hmmm!
  Governments, golfers, postage and lollies aside you are pushed to find
anything you can buy with it.
  A single button is now around five cents.  You can only buy small nails
or tacks pre-packed (the few exceptions where you can buy them separately
all smash through the one-cent ceiling).  If you want to weigh yourself
on public scales you can fork out anything up to five cents.
  So what are the cheapest goods you an buy these days?
  A pair of shoe laces are 35 cents, a box of tissues for 30 cents and a
potato cake about 20 cents.  Chocolates go by weight but if you want one
milk pastille you part with four cents.
  Paper clips, rubber bands, straws and matches all come in packets, although
singly they would be around one cent.
  The one-cent coin and the penny were much more useful 10, 20 or 30 years
ago.  
  The last generation recollect two licorice blocks for a penny, a one
penny bag of lollies and a cream-between (a slab of vanilla ice-cream between
two wafers) for two pennies - all the rage in the Fifties.
  Going further back, our cherished Footy Record (now 70 cents) was one
penny when first published in 1912 and only 10 cents when we went decimal
in 1966.
  But back to the question in hand.  Is there any real sense in keeping
it in circulation?
  The majority of shop owners I spoke to said no, although the milk bar
proprietors said that it came in handy for change from cigarettes and other
small items.  Not so handy when the change builds up and weighs down the
pockets.
  The principal use for it these days is to give one back to a person, almost
as a token gesture, after they have bought something for $XX.99.
  But wouldn't it be easier if all people selling merchandise stopped kidding
themselves that they are kidding us into believing that we are making a
huge saving if we buy something that is $9.99 instead of $10.  
  So as long as the mint keeps churning them out, then people will keep 
losing them, cursing them, collecting them or even on the odd occasion, 
buying something with them.
  Yet if we get rid of them where will we stop? Big brother (the two-cent
piece) is also about as useful as a hole in the head and therefore could
we soon see the day where the five, or even the 10-cent piece is the lowest
denomination.
  I'll leave you to ponder that as I must go and pay my Bankcard bill of
one cent.
  I wouldn't want a "PLEASE PAY UP, SECOND AND FINAL NOTICE" letter, now
would I?

  It seems that despite perennial gloom about high interest rates, the current

 <h> POLICE fury on car-bomb scare </h>

<bl> By NEIL McMAHON </bl>

Police were angry and disgusted over an elaborate eight-hour bomb scare
in Toorak Rd on Saturday.
  Assistant Commissioner (Operations), Mr John Frame, said if a stolen car
was planted near the site of last Sunday week's bombing as a hoax, the people
responsible were beneath contempt.
  "My feeling is one of disgust and anger," he said.
  "If it is an elaborate hoax then those responsible are below contempt.
  "The people of this area have been put through a very bad ordeal over
the past week and if it is a hoax they should be ashamed of themselves."
  Sen Det Stephen Keogh, of Prahran CIB, said the stolen car at the centre
of the scare had been finger-printed.
  He said he hoped this, with witnesses' accounts, would lead police to
the two men who stole the yellow Subaru coupe.
  The men told the owner on Saturday morning they wanted to take it for
a test drive.
  At about 12.15 pm the car was abandoned by one of the men near the corner
of Toorak and Punt Rds, only metres from the Turkish consulate building
destroyed in a bomb blast last Sunday week.
  Police took no chances with the car and cordoned off an area bounded*bound by
Punt Rd, Darling St, Domain Rd and Alexandra St before bringing in the special
operation group and Army bomb experts.
  Residents, shoppers, and shopkeepers were evacuated.
  The car was declared safe just after 8pm.
  The Army robot fired three shots into the car but failed to detonate the
suspected bomb.
  An Army bomb disposal expert wearing protective clothing later placed
explosives on the bonnet and blew open the front of the car.
  Police then declared the car safe and the area was reopened within an
hour.
  Mr Peter Thatcher, 28, said the man who abandoned the car quickly ran
away.
  "He was driving along up toward Punt Rd and then he did a quick half
U-turn and the car was blocking both lanes of traffic," he said.
  "He got out of the car and walked to the front of it and fiddled with
it for a couple of seconds then turned and ran."
  Mr Thatcher described the man as aged about 35, 178 cm tall, of solid
build and European appearance.  He was wearing shorts, a T-shirt and thongs.

 <h> Police break nurses' pickets </h>

<bl> By GERARD BROWN </bl>

  POLICE have started escorting hospital supply trucks after clashes at nurses'
picket lines at the weekend.
  Nurses and supporters were dragged from a picket line after trucks carrying
clean linen for about 20 hospitals were blocked at the central linen service
at the Royal Melbourne Hospital.
  Police also broke a picket line at the Freemasons' Private Hospital to
allow deliveries of clean linen.
  The lights of a truck were damaged when a car was used to stop trucks
leaving the central linen service, and police said they would take action
against a protester.
  Picketing nurses were joined by other union members at the weekend.
  The Royal Australian Nursing Federation state secretary, Ms Irene Bolger,
said yesterday police had acted violently and without reason.
  Miss Bolger will meet the ACTU secretary, Mr Bill Kelty, on the RANF's
20 wage and career structure claims after a mass meeting of nurses today.
  "The ACTU will be of some assistance in speaking to the State Government
but their involvement will not solve this dispute overnight," Ms Bolger
said.
  She said the nurses would give the Government a clear message of defiance
at the mass meeting by continuing the strike.
  Ms Bolger said the RANF wages claim withdrawn from the State Industrial
Commission last week had not been abandoned and could be re-submitted and
in an altered form.
  A full bench of the commission will resume hearing the Hospital Employees'
Federation  (No 1 branch) claim for the restructuring of junior nurses'
wages and career structure today.
  The Treasurer, Mr Jolly, said yesterday the RANF had adopted an incoherent
and inconsistent approach to resolving the 32-day strike.

 <h> Laser gun blasts on to toy lists </h>

<bl> By BRUCE BASKETT </bl>

<misc> NEW YORK </misc>

- A game in which children can shoot one another in the heart,
brain or belly with a laser beam is the fastest-selling new toy on the
Christmas lists this year.
  Lazer Tag is selling out in a day after shipments arrive at New York toy
stores.
  Last Monday 70 crates of Lazer Tag arrived at the famous F.A.O. Schwarz
store in Manhattan - and sold out in 10 minutes.
  The game involves wearing a vest, a belt and a cap with sensors placed
over the middle of the forehead, the belt buckle and the heart.
  A beam of infrared light is shot from the gun.  The sensor beeps and
flashes when it is hit by the light.
  Lazer Tag's suggested retail price is $US40.  It includes a light gun,
a sensor and a belt.  Two sets are needed to play the game with someone
else.
  The top 10 toys in order are G.I. Joe, Barbie, Pound Puppies, Teddy Ruxpin
(a bear that tells stories and was the biggest success last year), Lazer
Tag, Cabbage Patch Dolls, Transformers (movable space creatures)
Cricke*Cricket (a talking teenage girl doll), Baby Talk (a talking baby doll) 
and Mask (a series of action toys of the G.I. Joe type).

  The pair were the first Western pop act to visit China.
  Prince Charles started the move for Wham after seeing them at the Live

 <h> Ship's treasure `worth $2 billion' </h>

<misc> New York, Sun. AP </misc>

- The richest treasure ship ever discovered could yield
$2.47 billion in gold, silver, emeralds and historical artifacts, according
to a US treasure hunter.
  The Spanish ship Nuestra Senora de la Maravilla sank along the Bahama
Banks in 1656 with Central American treasure bound for Spain.
  Herbert Humphreys Jr said the wreck was covered with 15 metres of sand
but divers had uncovered emeralds, gold and silver coins and priceless Ming
Dynasty porcelain.
  Records show the ship also carried 30 to 40 tonnes of silver and a solid
gold metre-tall statue of the Madonna.
  In the early 1970s, a few million dollars of treasure was recovered.
  Many of the finds will go to public museums as well as Humphrey's planned
maritime museum.

<h> Wran to head CSIRO </h>

<misc> SYDNEY </misc>

 - Former NSW Premier Mr Neville Wran will head Australia's largest
scientific organisation, the CSIRO.
  And the news has stunned the science community.  Reactions at the weekend
ranged from dismay to delight.
  Federal Cabinet has broken a 60-year tradition to approve the appointment
of a non-scientist to the post.
  Mr Wran is understood not to have been the first choice for the post, but
no other contender could find the time. 
  Among the candidates were the doyen of Australian science, Sir Gustav Nossal,
and from the business world, Sir Roderick Carnegie.  But both these men
will be on the new CSIRO board.
  Under new CSIRO legislation which passed through Parliament on Friday,
Mr Wran will hold a part-time position.
  The present chairman, Dr Keith Boardman, is expected to be appointed
full-time chief executive by the new board, which includes a mix of scientific
and business acumen.
  Mr Wran and the rest of his revamped board will take up their posts from
January 1.
  The other new board members are Mr Bill Mansfield, an assistant secretary
of the ACTU; Mr David Hoare, the chairman of Bankers Trust Australia, and
Mr Tony Gregson, a businessman and farmer from Victoria's Western District.
  The surviving members from the old board are Professor Adrienne Clarke,
Mr Graham Spurling and Dr Kevin Foley.

 <h> Hotels hit hard by beer strike </h>

THE beer crisis worsened at the weekend as supplies dwindled in hotels
and retail outlets.
  The state president of the Australian Hotels' Association, Mr Daryl
Washington, said yesterday the situation with draught beer was "critical".
  "Many hotels are out of draught beer and packaged*packeged beer supplies are very
low," he said.
  "All hotels are in real trouble."
  "Even if the men went back to work tomorrow, it could take one to two weeks
before supplies got back to normal," Mr Washington said.
  "The strike is costing the community millions of dollars in Federal and
State Government tax and licence fees, all of which will have to be borne
by the public."
  Mr Washington said the viability of bottle shops and retailers was also
threatened by the strike.
  "The Federal and State Governments should get involved immediately and
make sure the union and the brewery get together to resolve the situation,"
he said.
  The brewery workers are striking for an extra week's Christmas bonus.
  A CUB spokesman said no talks were held with the union at the weekend.
  The company was waiting on the response of the strikers on a letter urging
them to return to work, he said.
  A spokesman for the Federated Liquor and Allied Industries' Union was
unavailable for comment.

  <h> Help for male rape victims </h>

A support group for male rape victims is to be set up in Melbourne next year.
  Ms Gayle McDonald, who formed a support group for female rape victims
two months ago, said yesterday she had received a number of calls from males
who had been raped.
None of the callers had been homosexual.
  "I was very surprised when I got the first calls," Ms McDonald said.
  "They are ordinary guys who have perhaps been at a party and been sexually
assaulted by other men.
  "Others have been assaulted after being at hotels or hitch-hiking, or
perhaps even at work.
  "It obviously goes on in the community to a greater degree than thought."
  The callers ranged from teenagers to middle-aged, married men.
  The Child Exploitation Unit had told her 80 per cent of the victims it
dealt with were males, she said.
  Ms McDonald said men faced many of the problems female rape victims faced
and felt they could tell no one what had happened.
  The sexual assault group can be contacted at the Victims of Crime Assistance
League office on 690-1877.

<h> Cashing in on croc craze </h>

<misc> BRISBANE </misc>

- You've seen the movie, now you can buy the pub.
  The Walkabout Creek Hotel, star attraction of the box office hit Crocodile
Dundee, is on the market and offers are rolling in.
  And a north Queensland man whose arm was bitten off by his five-metre
pet crocodile is set to cash in on the Dundee fever in the US.  
  The hotel, otherwise known as the Federal McKinlay Hotel, is at McKinlay,
a 20-house town 100 km south of Cloncurry in north-west Queensland.
  Success on the silver screen has rocketed the quiet country pub to stardom
with tourist coaches regularly stopping in McKinlay, according to publican
Mr Peter Ferris.
  The movie has meant so much to the hotel's image the Licensing Commission
has been asked to approve a change of name - to the Walkabout Creek, of
course.
  The facade of the hotel was changed for the movie and restored to its
original outback look when filming was complete.
  The selling agent, Ms Jenny Olsen, of L J Hooker Townsville, said the
novelty value of the property had attracted wide interest, especially from
buyers who wanted to make use of land around the hotel.
  Meanwhile Alf Casey, 69, a cane farmer from O'Connell River, 950 km north
of Brisbane, will appear on the Fox Network television stations owned by
Rupert Murdoch.
  "I think the American interest is a result of Crocodile Dundee. I expect
they will want me to talk about my recent experience," said Mr Casey, who
leaves for the US next week.

 <h> Herald spells out growth strategy </h>

THE Herald and Weekly Times Ltd strategy of increasing assets through major
acquisitions will help future growth, directors said in the latest annual
report released yesterday.
  "We consider the 1985-86 period a year of change and consolidation,"
the directors said.
  The report said plans to organise the HWT publishing network into a national
system were well advanced, and will provide exposure for advertisers in
any of the group's 142 papers. 
  "Australia's $3.3 billion annual advertising expenditure progressively
is being controlled by fewer people," directors said.
  "The advent of retail giants such as Coles Myer, Woolworths-Safeway gives
the HWT an exciting opportunity to benefit through its unique national
spread," directors said.
  The annual report said developing a national network concept, which
will also embrace overseas bureaus, builds a higher company profile and
more efficient use of journalists and technical resources.
  Despite a general downward trend in metropolitan newspaper circulation
which directors attribute to  changes in living and readership habits,
the HWT aggressively expanded its print activities.
  "We strongly believe in the future of newspapers and plans are in place
for further expansion," directors said.
  Through the acquisition of regional and suburban papers, HWT established
itself for the first time as a publisher in NSW.
  The strengthening of The HWT's print media activities is seen by market
analysts as consolidation of a profitable area of the group's operations.
  Directors said HWT consolidated profit, which accounted on a conventional
basis fell 4.4 per cent, was severely cut back by interest payments on
increased borrowings.
  Profit from trading and investment was 4.37 per cent less than last year,
in what directors described as a period of political and economic uncertainty.
  Directors described trading results as disappointing but they said some
recovery was evident in the second half of the year.

 <h>`Year of acquisitions' sees HWT assets nearly double </h>

REFLECTING a year of acquisitions, total assets of The Herald and Weekly Times
Ltd almost doubled to $1.08 billion in the September year.
  Shareholders' funds rose from $357.5 million to $733.3 million, including
paid capital, up from $57.7 million to $75.3 million, following several
acquisitions for shares.
  The full accounts also show a new item of "mastheads and other media
licences" among non-current assets, at $150.5 million.
  These only related to acquisitions made during 1985-86, mainly the NSW
former Consolidated Press papers and the Leader group.
  Group long-term liabilities have risen from $102.3 million to $111.9
million, while current liabilities are up from $122.7 million to $233.9
million.
  Investments have increased from $265 million to $365.4 million.
  Capital spending in the year lifted from $17.2 million to $41.9 million,
and notes to the accounts disclose unchanged outstanding commitments for
capital spending to September of $45.5 million.
  Directors said Herald Sun Travel returned a modest profit in its first
full year of operation, despite the effect of a depreciated Australian dollar
on the travel industry.  
  In addition, directors said the 3DB antenna site, situated on about 30
hectares of land at Heidelberg, was being subdivided and developed.
  The development should be ready for the market in early 1987.
  During the year, the company sold 280,000 shares in FM radio station EON
for $5.25 million, at a capital profit of 5.11 million.
  Small shareholdings in New Zealand News also were sold.
  Through the acquisition of Gordon and Gotch Ltd, the group has an effective
50 per cent share in Crawford Productions Holdings Pty Ltd.
  HWT also invested $200,000 more towards the $8.3 million already ploughed
into the production of full-length Australian film and TV mini series.
  Directors said a good part of the funds invested last year was still to
be realised.
  All productions are eligible for taxation concessions under Section

 <h>19,500 own share stake </h>

  THE Herald and Weekly Times had 19,500 shareholders, spread throughout
every state in Australia, at September 30.
  But Industrial Equity Ltd, Advertiser Newspapers and Queensland Press
all are substantial shareholders owning more than 10 per cent.
  The make up of the HWT share registry has been the subject of considerable
speculation and a detailed breakdown shows 17,000 shareholders own 5000
or fewer shares.
  Fifty-one per cent of HWT shareholders have held their shares for more
than 10 years.
  Further analysis reveals 9868 shareholders have between one and 1000
shares; 7344 have between 1001 and 5000 and 1368 hold between 5001 and 10,000.
  The chief executive, Mr John D'Arcy, holds 160,000 ordinary 50c shares
paid to 1c and another executive director, Mr E.J.L. Turnbull, holds 125,000
1c-paid shares.
  In September 1986 the acquisition of the Leader Media Group was paid for
by the issue of 4.85 million shares and cash payment.
  Directors said they considered it practical and prudent to acquire all
Gordon &amp; Gotch Ltd shares.

<h> The Sun `shows the way' </h>

DIRECTORS of The Herald and Weekly Times said The Sun showed there was a
strong future for newspapers.
  "We strongly believe in the future of newspapers, and plans are in place
for future expansion," they said.
  "The best example of the continuing future of newspapers is The Sun.
  "By any criteria it is an amazing success story.  An average daily
circulation in excess of 550,000 makes it an institution in Melbourne and
country towns throughout Victoria."
  Directors said The Sun was sold by 7500 newsagents and sub-agents
and home-delivered before most people rose.
  They said all afternoon newspapers were facing the difficult task of finding
answers to falling circulation.
  "Our policy is to establish The Herald as Melbourne's newspaper and this
year under the theme `Your Town - Your Paper' new sections and features
have been added," they said.
  "The Herald remains one of Australia's largest selling afternoon
newspapers, and compares favorably in circulation with most morning
newspapers."  
   Directors said that in regional areas the HWT was well represented, 
with The Weekly Times continuing to sell more than 100,000
copies a week.
  The Geelong Advertiser, The Geelong News and The Bellarine Echo all made
a major contribution to group profits, while the Bendigo Advertiser produced
a record profit, despite the depressed rural economy.
  With the acquisition of the Leader group, the HWT also became the largest
suburban newspaper publisher in Victoria.

 <h> Part-way on that privatisation path </h>

 THE chief executive of Qantas, Mr John Menadue, has again endorsed at
least some of the benefits of airline privatisation, but stopped short of
urging it should happen in Australia.
  Mr Menadue was speaking yesterday at an industry forum in Sydney.
  He said the world's airlines made a combined profit after interest charges
in 1985 on international scheduled services of about $US200 million, or
about enough to buy a single new jumbo jet between them.
  This profit represented a return of only half of one per cent on revenue
of nearly $US41 billion. 
  "The airlines are making one to two per cent profit, where they need eight
to nine per cent to finance investments and maintain a reasonable profit
level," Mr Menadue said.

<h> Hooker: Larger market and higher profit in US </h>

<misc> SYDNEY </misc>

- Mr George Herscu's Hooker Corp. Ltd yesterday blasted "anti-business"
Federal Government policies and blamed them for forcing the company to
expand overseas.
  Hooker executive director Mr Paul Carter, in a speech read at the annual
meeting by company secretary Mr Harry Berkovic, said the US offered the
company a larger market where it could achieve higher profit.
  Mr Carter's criticism follows similar attacks this week on the Federal
Government's economic policies by Industrial Equity Ltd's Mr Ron Brierley
and Coles Myer chairman Mr Bevan Bradbury.
  Mr Carter said in addition to the capital gains tax and fringe benefits
tax, which were disincentives to investment, the Federal Government was
adding imputation tax and the foreign tax credit system, all levied at the
"exceedingly high" rate of 49 per cent.
 "Unfortunately, the aggregate effect has forced Hooker to direct further
investment offshore," he said*ssid.
  "In striving to maximise its return on shareholders' funds, Hooker is
obliged to consider this climate as it adjusts its policies for 1987 and
beyond.
  "An increasing proportion of profit will come from our US operations,
where substantially lower interest rates and tax burdens allow Hooker to
achieve a reasonable return on investment.
  "We will continue to grow in Australia, but the rate offshore will be
significantly greater."
  Mr Carter said Hooker hoped the high interest rates, taxes and increased
business costs would fall.
  "But the rigid wage determination system. the tough work conditions imposed
by union leaders and the apparent anti-business attitude of the Government
make this unlikely," he said. 
  Hooker's growing overseas involvement was not solely a reaction to the
economic climate in Australia, but was part of a conscious fundamental
policy of minimising risk through geographic diversification.
  The executive chairman, Mr Herscu, told the meeting that US assets had
increased to 32 per cent from 28 per cent, and US profit had doubled to exceed
$20 million for the first time.

 <h> Wire fence prospect to curb footy louts </h>

<bl> By STEHPEN MEESE and PETER SIMUNOVICH </bl>

THE VFL might have to consider erecting wire barriers around football ovals
if violence became commonplace, the Sport and Recreation Minister, Mr
Trezise, said yesterday.
  Mr Trezise, commenting on Saturday's incident at Victoria Park, said
loutish behavior had to be stopped before it became uncontrollable.
  "We must nip in the bud any trend that could see Australian sports crowds
emulating the overseas situation, where on big sporting occasions special
police and army riot squads and equipment are needed," he said.
  Mr Trezise said he would discuss the incident, which resulted in the arrest
of six people, with the VFL commissioner, Mr Jack Hamilton, and the Police
and Emergency Services Minister, Mr Mathews, today.
  Mr Hamilton said yesterday the incident was "in the hands of the police
because no player was involved".
  "We are concerned about the crowd behavior, but the police will conduct
an investigation thoroughly and efficiently," he said.
  Asked if grounds would be barricaded to prevent any further violence
towards umpires, Mr Hamilton said: "Fortunately the incident is an isolated
one.
  "I think football crowds are wonderfully behaved, especially when you get
130,000 going to games week in and week out.
  "I don't think we should label our crowds on one incident.
  "Personally, I wouldn't like to see barbed wire around the grounds, but
we will have to monitor it.  If it happens frequently then we will have
to look at it."
  Mr Trezise said the Government shared the concern of the VFL and the 12
clubs on loutish behavior affecting innocent people and would help tackle
the problem at any time.
  He said incidents in which sports crowds were prepared to inflict violence
on umpires, players or officials simply because their team lost could not be
condoned. 
  More police might be needed at games to control outbreaks of violent
behavior.  
  "If violence became the norm, which I doubt, consideration would
have to be given to putting up wire barriers around the arena," he said. 
  Mr Trezise said he would regret seeing the installation of barriers to keep 
spectators off the ground.
  "I trust Saturday's occurrence was a rarity and merely a case of frustrated
barrackers getting carried away by the example of a few ringleaders," he
said.
- Melbourne psychologist Dr Francis Macnab said it was not uncommon for
people to behave violently when they thought they had been unjustly deprived
of victory.
  People also often behaved differently in a crowd to what they would
individually, he said.

 <h> Flare-up ugly and dangerous - police </h>

<bl> By JIM TENNISON </bl>

POLICE described Saturday's strife at Victoria Park as some of the ugliest
and most dangerous seen at a football ground.
  Four umpires were hit and jostled and two police injured when a near-riot
erupted near the umpires' race moments after Collingwood's one-point loss to
the Sydney Swans.
  The Sun's chief football writer, Peter Simunovich, was also attacked by
three men outside the Swans' dressing room.
  Police said the situation got out of hand when the angry crowd surged
forward and pushed two police horses together, leaving the field umpires
in front of them and the boundary umpires behind.
  A man ran up to field umpire Shane McDonald, 23, and spat on his chest.
  The man was pulled away by ground staff but broke clear to strike umpire
Peter Howe, 29, with a stiff-arm blow to the head.
  After viewing Channel 7 film of the incident, Sgt Wayne Miller of
Collingwood police believes he has spotted the man responsible.  He is
appealing for help to identify the spectator.
  Sgt Miller suffered a dislocated finger during the melee.  Sen. Sgt Ivan
Smith was treated for cuts and bruising.
  Police said a West Sunshine man had been charged for striking boundary
umpire Paul Nicholls, 33.  He has been bailed to appear in court on July 8.
The 22-year-old clerk was arrested immediately after the incident.
  Six people were charged with various offences, including being drunk.
  Sgt Miller said the man they are looking for was last seen going through
the members' area.
  He was aged 25-30, was 177-180 cm tall, of slight build, with brown hair
and a well-trimmed ginger beard.  He was wearing a scarf and blue or grey
jacket.
  "It was one of the ugliest incidents we have seen," Sgt Miller said. 
"There were blokes throwing half-full beer cans.  They were certainly fired
up."
  The Chief Commissioner, Mr Miller, said he expected a report on the 
incidents today.

 <h> Fans `acted like a lynch mob' </h>

A COLLINGWOOD cheer squad member yesterday said fans behaved like a lynch
mob after the defeat by the Sydney Swans on Saturday.
  David, 15, of Altona, said he saw elderly women, men and children abuse
umpires after the Swans' controversial one-point victory.
  He said three men punched one umpire and pushed around and spat on another,
while disgruntled fans threw mud at a goal umpire.
  "I felt disgusted that this sort of thing could happen in football, but
could see why they did it," he said.
  "The umpiring cost Collingwood the game."
  David who did not want his surname used, said he saw at least 1000 irate
Collingwood fans converge on the ground after the game.
  "You could feel in the air that something was going to happen," he said.
  "It was like a lynching mob, a riot.  Supporters came from everywhere.
  "I heard on the radio that only drunken louts were involved, but there
were all sorts of people.
  "Old ladies, men and kids yelling at the umpires to `give us a go'."

 <h> It's snow glow for skiers </h>

SNOW skiing enthusiasts couldn't have wished for better conditions at
the weekend. 
  All resorts reported heavy falls.
  The resort manager at Mr Hotham said it was the best opening to the season
for several years.
  "It is as close as you can get for perfect skiing this early," he said.
  Most resorts recorded falls of 50 cm or more.
  But accompanying the falls were sub-zero temperatures.
  Yesterday's maximum for Mt Buller was a chilly minus 3 degrees after
the overnight low of minus 5.6 degrees.
  The weather bureau spokesman said more snow was likely over the next few
days.
  Even Queenslanders shivered yesterday. In the southern interior towns
of Stanthorpe, Warwick and Surat, the mercury dropped to minus 5.

 <h> Skiers face an uphill cost battle </h>

AS snow begins to fall, Victorians need to look at their bank accounts closely
before considering weekends at the ski resorts.
  This year will not be cheap for ski enthusiasts.
  A day ticket at Mt Buller costs $28 for adults, a rise of $2 from last
season, and $14 for children.
  Mt Hotham is charging $27 for adults and $11 for children, while Falls
Creek day tickets cost $28 and $14 and those at Mt Buffalo are $13.50 and
$7.
  A day's skiing at Mr Buller will cost about $90 - that is based on the
approximate expense of a ski ticket, an $8 parking fee, about $15 for petrol,
$7 for lunch, an average of $12 to hire skis, boots and poles and $20 deposit
on the hire gear.
  It is possible to minimise expenses by sharing petrol and parking costs
and taking your own lunch.
  If you are thinking of a weekend at a resort, consider the cost of
accommodation, eating out, as a lot of lodges do not provide food, and two
days' skiing  and ski hire.
  The Alpine Resorts Commission has set up a permanent booking office at
Mt Buller.
  The commission's agent on the mountain, Ms Merryn Wildschut, said bookings
were taken for all commercial lodges and flats and for about eight smaller,
private lodges.
  "The top price on our books for a bed for one night is $80 to $85, without
breakfast," she said.
  "The price is a little less during the week, at $81, and for bed and
breakfast accommodation the cost is $189 a weekend.
  "The private lodges range from $22 to $24 a night for bed only, to $102
for dinner, bed and breakfast."
  It is advisable to book early in the week, rather than arriving on the
mountain and trying to get a bed.
  Travelling to the mountain by bus, which saves a lot of hassles, costs
$47 return from Melbourne with Mansfield-Mt Buller Bus Lines.
  The cost of ski gear has risen about 15 to 20 per cent on last year.
  This is largely due to the fall of Australian dollar, according to Auski's
clothing manageress, Ms Vicki Furniss.
  "Normally, you could expect a rise of between 5 and 10 per cent," she
said.
  Skis will cost from $195 to $499 without bindings, depending on the quality
and brand.  Bindings are priced between $120 and $240 for racing, while
boots range from $150 to $370.
  If you are looking to buy ski clothing, expect to pay about $165 for
a shower and snow proof ski suit, or $135 to $300 for stretch pants or
coveralls.
  A parka costs $200 to $420 for the fully waterproofed variety, while gloves
are priced from $30 to $50 in leather and $50 to $100 for Gore-tex.
   If buying is too expensive, skiers should consider hiring equipment.
 The average daily hire cost for skis, boots, poles and clothing is about
$25 to $30, compared with about $450 to buy for a beginner skier.
  Ms Furniss said enthusiasts wanting to hire skis could do so in Melbourne.
  "You order your skis here and pick them up on the mountain.  It saves
the hassle of carrying them up the mountain and trying to rent skis on a
busy weekend.

 <h> Snow food for all tastes </h>

EATING out at Mt Buller this season will cost only about $1 more than last
year.
  The mountain has 24 first-class restaurants and bars offering a variety
of meals, from quick snacks for skiers on the go, to cosy, candlelit dinners.
  Hungry hordes will find hearty meals of pasta, homemade pastries, spit
roast, seafood and Chinese.
  Anyone who has ever been to Mt Buller will have heard of, if not eaten
at, the Abominable Snowman, known as the Abom.
  The Abom's strawberry pancakes are renowned throughout Australia and are
always a highlight of a ski holiday feast. 
  They will again be on the menu this year priced around $4, along with
huge bowls of spaghetti for about $5.
  At the middle of the cost scale is Alpine Retreat on Sterling Rd.
  The restaurant is licensed and host Carl Mattern has been known to pour
out more than his fair share of complimentary drinks.
  Son Danny said a three course meal would cost about $15 this year. 
  Another popular restaurant, Breathtaker, will serve main dishes priced
about $17.50.
  Breathtaker's food is always delightful and the restaurant oozes class.
  The Arlberg at the top of Bourke St has three eating areas - Nooky's spit
grill restaurant, Albies and the bistro.
  Main meals will cost around $13.  Albies is a sort of brasserie, with
coffee and bagels for lunch and Albie cocktails and pancakes in the afternoon.
 Supper is served from 11 pm to 3 am.
  The Arlberg bistro is always jammed full at lunchtime.  Meals are quick
to go and prices won't break the bank.
  Hans Grimus, who runs the Pension Grimus, is a well-known identity.  If
you dine with him be sure to ask to try his "snuff."
  Main meals are priced around $14 at the Pension Grimus, with children's
meals also available.

<h> Taste of victory </h>

IT was a fairytale victory in anybody's books.  The tiny northern Victorian
town of Korong Vale had its first victory on Saturday afternoon after
63 consecutive losses in 3 1/2 years.
  The Vale beat Mitiamo, only one spot above it on the Loddon Valley League
ladder, 12. 9-81 to 7.14-56.
  Mitiamo lost its match the previous week by 39 goals.
  Korong Vale players said before the match they had a full team and
were confident of a win.
  "If we don't win today, there's no way we're ever going to win a match,"
one player said.

- Frustrated punters and horse owners now have their chance to own
a Melbourne Cup.
  The 1978 cup won by Arwon is up for sale.
  An advertisement in yesterday's Financial Review invited offers for the
18-carat gold cup.
  When Arwon (Nowra spelt backwards) won the Melbourne Cup he was owned
by a syndicate whose members included Nowra fisherman Mr Jack Watson and
Jack, Eric and Bob Doon, three brothers from Tumut.
  In 1984 the syndicate wound up and the Cup was bought by Mr Bob Doon for
$18,000.
  The 13-year-old became a NSW mounted police horse after he left racing
in 1982 with $370,000 stake winnings and now spends his time at a farm

 <h> Brooklyn `fairy' packs a punch </h>

<bl> By BRUCE GUTHRIE in Los Angeles </bl>

WHEN Mike Tyson was growing up in Brooklyn, the kids used to call him "little
fairy boy" because of his painfully shy, almost effeminate ways.
  But they daren't call him that now. 
  Tomorrow that "little fairy boy", now a massive fighting machine, is set
to rewrite the record books by becoming the youngest heavyweight boxing
champion in the history of the "sweet science".
  Tyson, 20, will fight 33-year-old Trevor Berbick for the World Boxing
Council heavyweight championship at the Las Vegas Hilton about 2.30 pm
(Melbourne time).
  Despite his youth and his challenger status, Tyson goes into the bout
a 5-1 favorite to thwart Berbick's first defence of the crown he won from
Pinklon Thomas in March.
  If, as many expect, Tyson takes the WBC title from Berbick, he will become
the youngest heavyweight champ.  That honor has long been held by Floyd
Patterson, who achieved it five weeks before his 22nd birthday back in 1956.
Tyson turned 20 on June 30.
  The story of Tyson's rise from impoverished child to delinquent youth
to championship contender is an inspiring tale.
  There is a view in boxing circles the sport is only as good as its
heavyweights.
  Given the paucity of class acts in the division, Tyson has been like a
breath of fresh air for the sport since he turned pro in March 1985.
  In the ring he looks and is frighteningly efficient.  There are no frills -
his standard attire is black trunks and black, ankle-length shoes.  He has
been aptly likened to a hungry doberman.
  Tyson, although short for a heavyweight - about 1.8 metres - has a body
like a tip-truck.
  Weighing in at 98 kg, his head, which in repose looks like a chunk of flesh,
devoid of features, sits atop a 50cm neck.  Most experts agree it will take
some punch to snap it back towards the canvas.
  Tyson grew up the youngest of three children in the Bedford-Stuyvesant
section of Brooklyn.  He says he never knew his father and that his mother
detested violence.
  Given her timid ways and that his earliest playmate was his sister and
not his older brother, Tyson says he picked up some almost effeminate
mannerisms.
  These brought some painful epithets from the tough kids of his neighborhood.
  "When I was younger, they used to call me `little fairy boy'," he said.
  "I was always gentle, really gentle."
  In time, Tyson learned to fight, especially when his mother, Lorna, moved
the family to the even tougher Brownsville area of Brooklyn.
  Tyson has said he was forever being robbed by neighborhood youths.  They'd
also beat him up for good measure.
  But even 10-year-olds have their breaking point - and for Tyson it was
when a tough tried to steal one of the pigeons he was raising near home.
  Tyson says he doesn't know what came over him but, almost effortlessly,
he beat the living daylights out of the older would-be thief.
  Soon, Tyson says, he was fighting constantly.  It was a way of being accepted
by a neighborhood that had been so hostile to him.
  He fell in with the wrong crowd and was caught up in a world of petty
and not-so-petty crime.
  Almost inevitably he found his way to a school for delinquent boys, the
Tryon School in New York.
  When he arrived at age 13 he had the reading capacity of a third-grader
and the attitude of a hardened criminal.
  He'd also broken his mother's heart.  "My mother used to ask me, `How can
you steal?  I never stole anything in my life.'
  "I know she was embarrassed, because she had a lot of pride.
  "I was haunted and I just didn't care.  I became so obnoxious."
  But the Tryon School wound up being Tyson's salvation for it was there
he met one-time amateur boxing champion Bobby Stewart, who was working
at the school as a counsellor/guard.
  Stewart worked with Tyson and soon saw the powerfully built kid's potential.
 At the same time, Tyson's other teachers at Tryon noticed a huge improvement
in their student.
  At first, because of his hostility and limited abilities they suspected
Tyson was retarded, but he made extraordinary progress.
  A former teacher, Robert Georgia, recalled:  "Boxing was what interested
Mike.  He used to go to bed here every night with his boxing gloves.
  "When he came here Mike was real down.  He was real quiet and mean.  Then
we saw a change in his personality - he came out of his shell."
  Boxing tutor Stewart acted on his hunch that he had a champion.
  He took Tyson, still only 13, to ageing trainer Cus D'Amato, who had trained
Patterson to his title more than two decades before.
  D'Amato and an assistant, Kevin Rooney, now a Tyson trainer, watched
as the manchild and Stewart sparred.
  "I said maybe this guy is lying about his age," Rooney said.
  "He was 13 but he had the body of a man.  He sparred with Bobby and Bobby
opened up on him.  But Bobby told us, `This kid can punch like hell'."
  Six years later professional fighters would say much the same thing after
being mauled by Tyson.
  Eddie Richardson, a heavyweight whom Tyson dispatched little more than
a minute into the first round of their fight last year, was asked immediately
after the bout if he'd ever been hit so hard.
  "Yeah," Richardson said.  "About a year ago, when I was hit by a truck."
  D'Amato recalled he told Tyson at the end of that first day in his ring
that if the boy behaved himself he'd teach him how to fight.
  "He (Tyson) didn't talk much then.  He was very silent; he didn't trust
anybody," D'Amato said.
  Twelve months on, the trainer became the 14-year-old Tyson's legal guardian.
No longer were they boxer and trainer - more father and son.
  Tyson moved to D'Amato's sprawling Catskill home and learned the gospel
of boxing, the 72-year-old man says.
  Tyson was a success as an amateur, but it is as a pro he has really made
his mark.
  When he steps into the ring at the Hilton tomorrow he will have fought
27 times professionally.  
  He has won 25 of those by knockout and the other two on 10-round decisions.
  Indeed, he was such a spectacular contender early on that within a year
of turning pro the giant ABC television network had signed him to a $850,000
four-fight contract.
  He still lives at D'Amato's home in New York, and still keeps pigeons.
  He has a girlfriend and knows he can earn more in the ring than he could
have earned by stealing.
  He often marvels at how far he has come in such a short time.  After all,
it was only seven years ago he was seemingly trapped on a short road to
crime and punishment.
  Still, although his life has been one of triumph over adversity, there
remains great sadness going into tomorrow's bout.
  Gone from his life are the two people who meant most to him, his mother
Lorna and D'Amato.  Mrs Tyson died of cancer in 1982; D'Amato from pneumonia
last November.
  Tyson makes no secret of the fact the two losses have left a great
hollowness in his young life.
  "I'm going to do well," he says matter-of-factly, "but when I come down
to it, who really cares?  I like doing my job, but I'm not happy being
victorious.
  "I fight my heart out and give it my best, but when it's over, there's
no Cus to tell me how I did, no mother to show my clippings to."

 <h> Jan's controversy on a par with her success </h>

<bl> By Michael Davis in Perth </bl>

JAN STEPHENSON looked stylish enough in bright slacks and top as she breezed
around Lake Karrinyup golf course.
  One might even have conceded she's reasonably well-preserved for 35 and
not unattractive.
  But out on the fairways and around the greens, Jan neither looks or acts
like the reputed sex kitten of international women's sport.
  This week, it's been the length of her birdie putts, not her skirt, that
has had male members of the gallery ogling.
  And when called to the microphone to accept a gold medallion she won after
teaming with Greg Norman in an international challenge match, she gushed
cliches with the innocence of a girl-next-door.
  Yet only last weekend, Dunlop Slazenger released Jan's 1987 golf calendar
pictures to Sunday papers across the country to coincide with her arrival.
  Jan flew into Sydney prepared for a feminist furore over the seven
provocative poses but said:  "While the guys want to see me, I guess I'll
continue to take off my clothes for the camera."
  Last year she was in a poster impersonating Marilyn Monroe with the caption:
"Play a round with me."
  The picture originally appeared in an LPGA magazine and caused a storm
among fellow professionals.
  Former US Open champion Jane Blalock has been one of Jan's sternest critics.
  "I am totally opposed to what I call quasi-pornography being used to market
our tour," Blalock said on a prime-time national TV interview in the US.
  "Is our organisation so desperate, so unaware of the real glamor and
attraction staring it in the face, that it must resort to such trash?"
  Through the criticism, Jan, said to have a standing offer of $150,000
to pose for Penthouse, remains unmoved.
  The Balmain girl has learned to live with controversy since she was
reprimanded by starchy Australian Ladies' Golf Union officials for wearing
psychedelic panties under a mini-skirt when she was a teenager.
  Since she turned professional, Jan's personal life has resembled a TV
"soapie."
  Yet through numerous personal crises she has played superb golf - winning
a US Open, US PGA and becoming the first woman to break 200 for a 54-hole
tournament.
  Four years ago a London newspaper asked:  "Is Jan Stephenson a femme fatale,
who drives men out of their minds with her sexual magneticism?
  "Or is Jan Stephenson, for all her education, looks and talent, a weak
and embarrassingly insecure female, clearly influenced and manipulated
by men for their own power and financial gain?"
  At the time she was the central figure in a bizarre tug-of-war between
Eddie Vossler and Larry Kolb, who each claimed to be her husband.
  When Jan sought to have her two-month marriage to Kolb, then her manager,
annulled he tried unsuccessfully to have her committed to a mental hospital.
  Kolb then gained a court order to freeze her assets, claiming Vossler
had manipulated her. 
  Kolb claimed Jan had become a "tiny caged bird".
  Eventually a judge ruled Jan could not be married to Kolb because under
Texas law, she was already Vossler's common law wife.  Jan's life story,
Open Season, is said to be "in the pipeline".
  Her choice to play the lead in the film version of the book is Cheryl
Ladd.
  It should be a box office hit but its*it's completion is not one of Jan's
major goals at the moment.  She's obsessed with improving her golf game.
  A  fitness and health fanatic, Jan does aerobic exercises and swallows
fists full of vitamin pills daily.
  "I want to be the most famous female athlete in the world," she said.

<h> Footy star tells of lost $6000 </h>

FORMER VFL footballer Phil Carman lost his $6000 deposit on a frozen chicken
and egg sales venture, the County Court was told yesterday.
  Carman, 35, a sub-contractor of Bendigo, said he agreed to buy the franchise
in 1980 after reading an advertisement he could earn between $350 and $400
a week.
  He said he paid the deposit for what he believed was the sole Ferntree
Gully franchise to sell Victoria Egg Board eggs.
  Robert Ashley Lewis, 42, of Minchinbury Drive, Vermont South, has pleaded
not guilty to 41 counts of obtaining property by deception and two counts
of attempting to obtain property by deception between January 1979 and
September, 1983.
  The trial is not finished.

 <h> Tribute to a riding legend </h>

<h> Motorcycling  </h>

<bl>- Wayne Gregson </bl>

KEN RUMBLE probably would have been embarrassed to hear what everyone has
been saying about him this past week or so.
  But those who knew him were trying to find words to describe his phenomenal
abilities on two-wheel machinery.
  Ken Rumble, 59, Australian motorcycle champion for many years, was buried
last week after succumbing to a wasting illness.
  His friend and on-track competitor Hughie Hoare said there would hardly
be a motorcycle club in the land which would fail to mark his passing.
  "I don't think there'll ever be another rider like him, or as good as
him," he said.
  "He was the best all-rounder Australia has seen.
  "He raced and won on almost any sort of bike in any sort of motorcycle
sport.
  "He even had a go at speedway, about one season if I remember correctly,
but he said he could never come to grips with that wooden fence.  He was
a great slider."
  Ken Rumble began his peculiar motorcycle racing career soon after World
War 2 and soon discovered he had an ability to go fast on virtually any
motorcycle.
  He performed the seemingly impossible one year by picking up all the
national scramble titles, 125cc, 250cc, 350cc and 500cc, on the famous 125cc
Walsh BSA Bantam.
  "In one meeting which comes to mind" Hughie Hoare said, "he reckoned he
was going to ride a road Manx Norton in a grass track meeting.  We all laughed
at that.  It was outrageous to ride a Manx on the grass.
  "I mean, this was a pucka road racing bike.
  "But he turned up and wheeled the thing off the trailer.  He'd put wide
bars on it, grass-track tyres, speedway type footpegs.  Sure enough, he
was going to give it a go against all the grass track JAPs.
  "He won all the races he entered."
  After hanging up his solo road-racing leathers, Ken Rumble decided to
race side-cars.
  His career ended only 10 years ago after a nasty side-car accident on
the old Hume Weir circuit in which he badly injured a leg.  He'd been racing
- and winning - for 30 years.
  "Young people who never saw Ken Rumble ride have really missed out on
something," Hughie said.
  "What made him so good, so long? I don't know.  There seemed to be nothing
he couldn't do.  Perhaps it was bred into him.  Who knows?
  "And you know, for all his success, he was a helluva nice guy as well."
  Someone once explained the difference between a good rider and a champion
rider as follows: "A good rider will win on a good bike.  A champion will
win on anything.
  In which case Ken Rumble more than qualified.
  AUSTRALIA's largest annual historic motorcycle meeting will be held at
Phillip Island on October 18-19.
  The meeting, which attracts more than 200 entries, some from overseas,
includes classic (pre-1963) post-classic (1963-1972), solo and sidecar racing.
  There will also be static displays of antique motorcycles, a vintage parade,
and a concourse d'elegance.  A restored 1957 Triumph will be raffled and
drawn on the Sunday.
  A TRIUMPH pageant will be held between 8 am and 1 pm on Saturday, October
25, as part of National Motorcycle Month.
  Motorcycles will gather in Elizabeth St between Lonsdale and LaTrobe
Sts and then a parade will take them through the streets to Albert Park
Lake.

 <h> Penalty harsh - Games star </h>

<misc> CANBERRA </misc>

- Outed Canberra swimmer Jody McGibbon believes she and Queenslander
Brett Stocks were singled out by Australian swim officials for misbehavior
at the Edinburgh Commonwealth Games.
  McGibbon, 17, who faces a 12-month suspension for drinking alcohol at the
Games, said on Canberra's radio 2CA yesterday penalties meted out by Australian
Swimming Inc. were too harsh.
  The swimmers were told of their suspensions at the weekend.
  Stocks' two-year ban for his part in using a courtesy car from the Games
Village bars him from the '88 Seoul Olympics and could end his career.
  It is understood both can train but are ineligible for vital pre-Olympics
meets.  McGibbon said she was not aware of the full penalty for misbehavior
when she left for the Games.
 "I signed a document saying that I wouldn't consume any alcohol, drugs
and so on and I did," she said.
  "It has always been traditional that you all go out after and celebrate,
but this year it has just been changed.
  "I had a few drinks after which was on the statement," she said.
  McGibbon will not know until October 1 if the ban will affect her
Australian Institute of Sport scholarship.
  An AIS spokeswoman said a review of McGibbon's position was likely.

THE Melbourne City Council last night registered its opposition to this Sunday's
race meeting at Moonee Valley and future Sunday racing.
  Cr Bill Gardiner, moving a motion against the meetings, said trotting
at Moonee Valley caused Flemington and Essendon  serious traffic
congestion, affecting residents.
  He said Melbourne and Essendon councils had opposed the over-use of "a
particular race track in Essendon".
  Cr Neil Cole said he opposed future consideration of Flemington race course
for Sunday racing.

  Title leader Mansell led unchallenged throughout in his Williams and was
rewarded with a 10 point buffer at the head of the standings.
  World champion Alain Prost of France took advantage of a late spin by
Piquet and a seemingly empty fuel tank suffered by Brazilian Ayrton Senna
on the last lap, and squeezed home second in his McLaren.  Piquet (Williams)
and Senna (Lotus) finished third and fourth.
 Australian Alan Jones (Haas Lola) spun out of the race early on.

 <h> Grand prix ace to miss Hardie 1000 </h>

BRILLIANT young grand prix driver Gerhard Berger has scratched from Sunday
week's James Hardie 1000.
  Berger's sponsor, Benetton, will not let the 26-year-old Austrian come
to Australia, fearing the pressure of a trip Down Under for a long touring
car race a week before the Mexican Grand Prix would be too much. 
  He will be replaced in the Bob Jane T-Marts BMW by German touring car ace
Dieter Quester.
  Quester is no stranger to the Bob Jane car - it's the same Schnitzer-prepared
BMW he drove to victory in the world's toughest touring car race, the
Spa-Francorchamps 24-hour, a couple of months ago.
  At Bathurst he will share it with another top European BMW driver, Roberto
Ravaglia of Italy.
  Ravaglia was rookie of the year at Bathurst last year with a second with
Johnny Cecotto in a BMW.
  The Ravaglia-Quester car will retain its BMW colors, blue purple and red,
instead of Bob Jane's familiar orange.
  A spokesman for the Bob Jane Corporation, which is running five cars at
Bathurst, said Berger had confirmed he could not make it to Bathurst due
to formula 1 commitments.
  Racing at Bathurst would have meant two Australian trips in three weeks
for Berger who often races with Ravaglia in European touring car races.

 <h> A Gully merger warning </h>

<h> Soccer </h>

 <bl> by Peter Desira </bl>

GREEN GULLY should consider a merger before it disappears into oblivion,
according to George Cross president Alf Zahra.
  "Now that they have been relegated from the National League, it will take
a lot of hard work to get the club back on the rails in the next year,"
Zahra said yesterday.
  "You only have to look at clubs that never recovered once they took the
plunge - Mooroolbark is a prime example, sinking to the lower reaches of
the VSF once it got knocked out of the NSL.
  "And the mighty sides of the '60s - Polonia and Ringwood City - have never
been able to fight back to their former strength.
  "It wouldn't surprise me if a club like Green Gully moves to the verge
of non-existence*non-existance within a year."
  Gully and George Cross have been arch rivals for 20 years mainly because
they attract support largely from the Maltese community.
  Gully has the better facilities at Green Gully Reserve, while Cross has
always had the bigger following and a merger between the two clubs has
often been seen in soccer circles as the ideal solution for one stronger
club.
  But intense rivalry has always put a stop to the possibility and the
committees were put under pressure when talks were suggested two years
ago.
  Zahra still believes it would be ideal but will not make approaches.
  "We made the initial move last time and were rudely told off, so it's now
a situation of once bitten, twice shy.
  "However we remain the club prepared to listen, and if the few heads that
there are at Green Gully use logic, I still believe that the linking up
of the two clubs would be the ideal solution for us (the Maltese community)
to become a force to be reckoned with not only in Victoria but throughout
Australia."
  Green Gully has lost much of the drive it used to go from the lower reaches
of the Victorian League to enter the NSL despite its poor support.
  The club needs a massive shake-up but has no ready-made replacement for
Guy Spiteri, who has become disillusioned*dissillusioned with the soccer 
set-up and is determined to step down as president at the end of the season.
  Spiteri played down the situation and remained defiant despite Zahra's
gloomy predictions.
  "The NSL clubs are still living in dreamland and the league cannot be a
goer for much longer when the 24 clubs owe the league around $330,000,"
Spiteri said.
 "We'll just go back quietly to the State League and wait for all of the
rest (the seven Melbourne NSL clubs) to come back.
 "Green Gully will win the State League next year just to get the opportunity
of knocking back the invitation to join the NSL," Spiteri said.

<h> Runaway winner </h>

SCOTT FRASER is runaway winner as Green Gully's player of the year.

<h> Appeal date </h>

THE appeal against Brunswick Juventus developing the former Brunswick tip
site into the club's home ground will be heard on November 5.
  The club wants to establish Clifton Park, now cluttered with rubbish
and weeds, into a soccer stadium with grandstand, social club as well
as having training grounds, a tennis court and bocce rinks.
  Juve has the support of the Planning and Environment Minister and the
Brunswick council.
  A small protest group has claimed the area was promised as open public
space.
  Juve administrators believe this appeal is the last avenue for the 
protesters*protestors and are hopeful the three-member appeal board will 
rule in favor of the club to enable work to start on the project early next 
year.
  Juve vice-president Domenic Tenuta hopes the club will take a big contingent
of supporters to Adelaide this Sunday for the semi-final against Adelaide
City.
  Buses will leave Melbourne at 1 am Sunday and return straight after the
game.  Cost $40 return; bookings through Tenuta on 383 2213.

<h> He's my type of man, says Joh </h>

THE Premier, Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen, last night said he liked and respected
Mr Rupert Murdoch and complimented him on his Herald and Weekly Times takeover
bid.
  Speaking from Weipa, Sir Joh said: "Mr Murdoch's a progressive man who
has been known to myself for a long time.
  "We've always got on well and I'm sure we'll continue to do so.
 "He's a private-enterprise type of man and that's the type of man I respect."
  In Canberra, the Australan Journalists Association federal secretary,
Mr Neal Swancott, said the bid, coming a week after the Federal Government
announced new policies of cross-media ownership, was breathtaking in its
arrogance.           
  "It can be seen as a challenge to, and a defiance of, the Government,"
he said.

 <h> Conservatorium `bulging at the seams' on present site </h>

THE Queensland Conservatorium of Music wants to move to the Expo 88 site
on Brisbane's South Bank after the exposition.
  The idea is the latest in Brisbane's great debate - what to do with the
40 ha of prime real estate after the six-month, $250 million Expo finishes
on October 30, 1988. 
  The Conservatorium acting director, Mr Max Olding, yesterday said a proposal
had been put to the State Government mid-year but no answer had yet been
received.
  He said the Conservatorium, now on the Queensland Institute of Technology
campus, was bulging at the seams.
  A South Bank site next to the Cultural Centre would centralise the city's
cultural activities.
  The Queensland Institute of Technology deputy director, Dr Tom Dixon,
said the Federal and State Governments were sympathetic to the proposal,
which would make room for 800 extra QIT students.
  There were no proposals to move QIT to the Expo site.
  A spokesman for the Premier's Department said it was too early to discuss
whether the Conservatorium would relocate.
  The Expo Authority late last month called for worldwide expressions of
interest, to be lodged by February 16 next year.
  The authority, the Brisbane City Council and the State Government will
consider the submissions.
  The Expo chairman, Sir Llew Edwards, has said money is not the top priority
in the post-Expo scheme.
  It was an opportunity to leave the greatest memorial to Brisbane, he said.
  Yesterday, suggestions ranged from a State zoo, a drama centre, convention
centre and "realistic" proposals for a composite commercial, public space
and residential development.
  A senior partner in real estate agents Hillier Parker, Mr Rod Samut, said
the site was a valuation nightmare because it was not subject to town planning
regulations.
  It was tentatively worth about $300 million but its value was dependent
on what could be built there.
  "It is the most exclusive site in any capital city in Australia and it
should be given back to the people," Mr Samut said.
  "Brisbane doesn't have a zoo.  It would be marvellous site for perhaps
a maritime zoo for our young kids to enjoy.
  "It would be a shame to fragment the central business district by having
a commercial development on the site.
  "No one would propose another industrial development and there is not
a strong market for high "medium-rise residential areas."
  The Performing Arts Complex director, Mr Tony Gould, said a drama centre
on the site would complete Brisbane's magnificent cultural centre.
  He accepted that some commercial development was likely but hoped it
would complement the complex.
  The Brisbane Development Association president, Mr Noel Robinson, said
it was unrealistic to propose a zoo or to move educational institutions
to the site.
  "Expo will want the best dollar value it can get and there would have to
be a very good reason not to take the highest tender," he said.
  Mr Robinson said a likely result would be a mixture of commercial, open
space and residential uses.
  The director of architect firm Conrad and Gargett Pty Ltd, Mr Elwyn Wyeth,
said the site was ideal for an upmarket residential development, with about
20 percent devoted to commercial development.

 <h> Urgent talks called over shop protest </h>

AN URGENT State Industrial Commission conference today will try to avert
a shop assistants' stopwork rally against Queensland's deregulated shopping
hours trial.
  A meeting of 200 Queensland Shop Assistants Union Brisbane delegates
representing more than 15,000 members yesterday voted unanimously to hold
a protest rally in the Brisbane City Hall at 10 a.m. next Thursday.
  The Retailers Association later applied for a State Industrial Commission
conference and planned to call the commission to direct the cancellation
of any stoppages.
  The shop assistants' union State secretary, Mr John Hogg, said the rally
would cause a staff shortage in Brisbane stores.
  The stoppage was the first action in the union's campaign against the
one-month trial of unrestricted shopping hours starting on December 15.
  Mr Hogg said the normally conservative union was being forced to take
action.  "We are in boots-and-all to fight deregulation because of the State
Government's ignorance," he said.
 Mr Hogg said a "constant stream" of members had told him they would resign
if deregulated shopping was introduced.
  He accused the State Government of having no regard for the transport
and safety of young people who would be made to work odd hours.
  The Retailers Association executive director, Mr Phil Naylor, said he
believed the stopwork amounted to a strike.
  "If they are not at work, we consider they are on strike."
  He said the rally was "highly irresponsible and would affect many retailers
who were trying to bolster sales during the Christmas period after a poor
trading year.
  Mr Naylor said most retailers planned to follow the Business Owners and
Managers Association recommendations of not opening on Sundays but trading
on Saturday afternoons and one extra night a week.
  However, Myer planned to trade seven days a week from its Queen Street,
Brisbane, Gold Coast Pacific Fair, Toowoomba and suburban Brisbane stores,
he said.
  The Queensland Tourist and Travel Corporation and two Brisbane
international hotels yesterday said they believed extended trading hours
would help Brisbane's international image.
  A Brisbane Sheraton spokesman said Americans used to 24-hour trading had
commented on the lack of trading in the city.   
  A Mayfair Crest Hotel spokesman said international guests would appreciate
extended trading.
  The present shopping hours were not helping Brisbane's international
reputation, he said.
  The Queensland Tourist and Travel Corporation managing director, Mr Pat
King, said yesterday many people in the tourist industry supported deregulated
trading.
  The corporation itself supported deregulated trading hours, particularly
in areas of high tourist traffic.
  Australia rated below average as an international destination for good
shopping, partly because of restricted trading hours, he said.
  In Bundaberg, a meeting of about 80 percent of the city's retailers yesterday
voted to work the trading hours set by the State Industrial Commission.

 <h> Sack fear ties hands: union </h>

SHOP assistants feared the sack for industrial action, a Shop Distributive
and Allied Employees union organiser said yesterday.
  Ms Margaret Bennett said many were married women with children who had
to support their families.
  "The boss will walk into the office and say anyone who goes to the protest
rally is out," she said.
  One casual at Kmart, Toowomba, who declined to be named, said yesterday
she lived 20km from work and could not get transport late at night or afford
a late-night babysitter.
  "The employers aren't going to pay your taxi fare home like they do in
the public service," she said.
  "I didn't tell my employer I was going to the union meeting today because
they can sack casuals any time." 
  She was not confident staff would back the union call to stop work for
a mass rally next Thursday.
  "Even the permanents are afraid of losing their jobs, and the juniors
are fresh out of school and won't speak up.
  "If we withdrew our labor, there's plenty of people on the dole or on
school holidays who would step in."
  Ms Bennett said a permanent worker under 16 was paid $124.80 a week. 
"Many have said if they had to work odd hours they may as well go on the
dole.
  "Single mothers may have to go on to supporting parent's benefits because
they can't leave their children at night," she said.
  Another casual said she would be afraid to walk 300 m to her car alone
after working late.
  Ms Bennett said:  "The Government has not considered the effects of
deregulation on ordinary people's lives.

<h> CIA ran guerrilla war fund:  report </h>

<misc> WASHINGTON </misc>

- The United States Central Intelligence Agency ran a $500 million
account in Switzerland to bankroll anti-communist guerrillas in at least
three countries, a report said last night.
  The Washington Post said arms were purchased with the fund for
anti-government forces in Angola, Moslem guerrillas in Afghanistan and
Nicaraguan Contra rebels.
  Money in the account included profits from US arms sales to Iran.
  The report said the fund contained $US250 million (A$387 million) secretly
appropriated by Congress to aid rebels fighting Soviet troops in Afghanistan
and an equal amount from Saudi Arabia which was used to buy Soviet, Chinese
and other arms from dealers.                           
  Congressional investigators had found that the $US10-30 million (A$15-46
million) in profits from the Iranian operation was put into the same bank account.
  An administration source was quoted as saying the Swiss account supplied
funds from which "the various accounts involving the Reagan doctrine are
administered".
  The doctrine referred to is the President's policy of supporting insurgents
battling communist governments in the Third World.
  The CIA is supposed to keep separate records of how the funds are disbursed
but a Congressional source told the Post the agency was having trouble
identifying separate accounts and military purchases.
  By law, the CIA is supposed to turn over any profits from sale of material
to the US Treasury.
  The Swiss fund was administered by the CIA but had been monitored by the
National Security Council deputy director, Mr Donald Fortier, who died earlier
this year.
  Since Mr Fortier's death, the source said, the job was apparently handled
by Marine Lt Col Oliver North, who was fired from his NSC job last week.
  The US Attorney-General, Mr Edwin Meese, has described North, now under
questioning by the Senate intelligence committee, as the only person who
knew precisely about the profits of the Iran arms sale and their diversion
to the Contras.
  Members of Congress are questioning whether the diversion of funds to
the Contras violated the Boland Amendment which prohibited the use of US
finances for military aid to the Nicaraguan rebels.
  Meanwhile, Congressional leaders yesterday hailed President Reagan's move
to appoint a special prosecutor over the Iran-Contras scandal.
  They said it was a first step towards resolving the political crisis
engulfing his Administration.
  They also unanimously welcomed his appointment of Mr Frank Carlucci, 56,
as the new National Security Adviser - the fifth during Mr Reagan's six
years of office.

 <h> Eighth Rhine leak in a month </h>

<misc> WALDSHUT, West German. - </misc>

About 2.5 tonnes of a packaging chemical leaked from a factory into the
Rhine River yesterday.
  It was the eighth reported industrial accident along the river in a month.
  Officials said the polyvinyl chloride (PVC) leaked from the Lonza chemical
factory in Waldshut in extreme south-western West Germany when a worker
left a valve open.
  The spill was discovered when a resident noticed the Rhine turning shades
of green and white for a kilometre downstream from the plant.
  Mr Lorenz Fischer, a spokesman for the Baden-Wuerttemberg State Environment
Ministry in Stuttgart, said about 7 kg of the leaked substance had been in
concentrated form and "relatively poisonous".
  But he said it was unlikely to endanger fish and plant life because it
was lighter than water and would remain on the river's surface.
  Waldshut sits on the Rhine where the river forms the Swiss border.
  The town is about 60 km upstream from Basel, Switzerland, where a 30-tonne
spill of industrial chemicals on November 1 contaminated long stretches
of the Rhine downstream, mainly in West Germany.

 <h> Leaf shedding an odd characteristic </h>

J.M. of BUNDABERG, has young leopard trees growing on a property.
  About one-third dropped their old leaves and quickly made new growth,
now the new leaves are falling.  Why didn't the rest of the trees shed their
leaves?
  This is an odd characteristic of leopard trees.  I have seen trees shed
their leaves three times in a year, sometimes within six weeks of new growth.
  The reasons are obscure - it is probably tied in with temperature changes
or some other climatic factor.

M.J.R. of SUNNYBANK HILLS, submitted for diagnosis a disease troubling
the skin of a bisexual papaw which was badly scarred.  The leaves have
shrivelled.  Lime Sulphur spray has been used.
  The damage is the result of a powdery mildew fungus infection.  Lime sulphur,
if used as regularly as stated, should have controlled the disease.  Powdery
mildew is a winter disease.  In future use only wettable sulphur sprays
as lime sulphur can damage plants under the local warm growing conditions.

N.B. of MOOROOKA, asked why lima bean leaves were yellowing and falling.
  Sight unseen it is difficult to diagnose accurately.  It could be
overwatering, however I would expect the vines also to be affected and
begin to collapse.

V.P.F. of PALM BEACH, is concerned by the lack of worms in the garden
despite using compost.  The site has been filled with sand.
  No matter how much compost or other organic matter is used, the only way
to ensure worms is to put some into the soil.  They will quickly multiply
if the organic matter is there to support them.  Try to obtain some from
someone else's garden or buy some from a commercial worm farm.  Sonwise
Worms, Box 68, Esk 4312 sell worms at $17 per 1000, postage paid.  By the
end of one year they should have multiplied to at least 40,000, if soil
conditions suit.

H.McF, of ISLE OF CAPRI, recently visited Toowoomba gardens where three
plants attracted attention: (1) a white flowering shrub, (2) a yellow to
orange-flowered annual, (3) a plant called blue pacific.  Samples of 1 
and 2 were submitted. 
  (1) is double white may, Spiraea cantonensis flore plene, often called C.
reevesiana.  (2) is Californian poppy, Eschscholzia californica, extremely
useful for trailing over terrace walls.  It must be grown in full sun and
have good soil drainage.  (3) I suggest blue pacific may apply to a deep
blue flowered form of Rosmarinus officinalis, the rosemary.
  To improve your soil, incorporate copious amounts of leaf compost and
use light applications of a complete fertilizer formula frequently.  This
should be standard procedure for all pump-filled areas which have been topped
with a thin layer of soil.
G.H. of TARINGA, has two problems with garden plants.  A Eugenia has pockmarked
foliage and potted ferns and coleus are slowly dying.  The soil in the pots
is heavily infested by small ant-like insects.
  The Eugenia Australis, or as it is now known Syzygium australis, scrub
cherry or lillipilli, is troubled by a small wasp which stings the leaf to
lay eggs.  Small galls and depressions result.  The species in question
is rather prone to attack, I doubt if much can be done to control it.  You
could try spraying young foliage with Diazinon.  You may have ants in the
pots, they farm out root aphids and mealy bugs on the root systems.  These
pests quickly debilitate the plants, also the tunnelling by the ants causes
excess aeration which in turn dries up the root hairs.
This action alone can kill plants.  Water the soil with a solution of Diazonin
at spray strength.  This will dispel the offender, even if it is not an 
ant.

L.P. of MARYBOROUGH, sent foliage of a tomato bush which was curled, distorted
and had a rusty and silvery sheen.
  The condition is due to mite damage.  Dispose of all badly affected plants
in future.  Spray young plants regularly with a miticide, such as Kelthane,
Rogor or Wettable Sulphur.

M.A. of CLEVELAND, has noted two plants in a batch of 50 gerberas are producing
green flowers.  On one plant the flower is partially deformed.
  The condition is most likely due to infection by a virus, for which there
is no cure.  Remove the problem plants and dispose of them in the garbage
bin.  Spray the rest regularly with an insecticide to control sap sucking
insects, such as aphids and thrips, as these carry the virus.

J.A. of BURLEIGH, asks for recommendations for two plants suitable for
growing in tubs on a balcony facing the sea.
  The best plant I know for such a position is the variegated form of
Metrosideros excelsa or New Zealand Christmas bush.  Clip twice a year
to keep it compact, and give the tub a quarter turn each month so light
does not unbalance growth.  This should ensure you have good plants.  A
matching pair is advised.

FREQUENTLY readers request advice on how to establish a good lawn.
  At this time of the year many new lawns are laid down.  Quite a number
will end up looking very ordinary, simply because the approach to laying
the turf was:  "It will be OK, it's only grass."  If the laying techniques
are slipshod it may take years to get the lawn to a good standard
  The area to receive the turf should be level in accord with the natural
fall of the land.  A thin layer of fine sand is spread evenly over the site
to enable the roots to bed in.  Each row of turf is closely butted against
the other, and fine sand placed in any crevices.  Each row is firmed down
with the back of a spade or tamper.
  The newly-laid turf must be well watered and kept evenly moistened until
it has established.  Mowing is not advised sooner than three weeks after
laying, as it could cause lifting.
  The first mowing should be higher than normally acceptable, just to tidy
up the growth.  Mowing settings are progressively reduced until the turf
has reached the height suitable for sound management and good presentation.

 <h> Myth and fable alive and well on the Australian wine scene </h>

  WINE, because its history extends for thousands of years, has always been
a subject for fables, myths and traditions.
  Until that illustrious French scientist, Louis Pasteur, established the
basic nature of the fermentation process, the wine lover had an almost
mystical view of wine.  Many still do.
  Although much of the fable and myth has gone, there are probably hundreds
of mistaken beliefs that are held by some wine drinkers.  Many of these myths
have a basis in truth, but the oenologist or viticulturist now has the
tools at his or her disposal to remove the agreeable romanticism and establish
the facts.
  There is a widespread belief in the Australian wine-drinking community
that all dry red wines improve with age and all dry white wines should be
consumed within weeks or months of purchase.  There must be millions of
bottles of dry red wine stored in cellars, garages, under houses and in
cupboards that would have been better drunk the day purchased.
  Equally, many fine Australian chardonnays, semillons and rhine rieslings
would benefit from some years in the cellar.  Whether a wine will improve
with keeping depends on its acidity, pH, alcohol level, tannin and a number
of other factors.  Ask the winemaker!
  For many years the red wines of the Hunter Valley made from shiraz (sometimes
called hermitage) grapes were described as having a character known as
"sweaty saddle".  This odor is now known to be caused by the presence of
hydrogen sulphide, or worse still its chemical successors, 
mercaptans*mercaptanns and disulphides.
  The character is, in fact, a major wine fault and Hunter winemakers are
now rarely guilty in this regard.  Wine drinkers however continue to talk
about this "desirable" quality.
  This fault is related to the view that all red wines should "breathe".
 A century ago custom decreed the wine was opened some hours before drinking
and then decanted.  This, it was said, removed the "bottle stink". It did
in fact allow the worst of the hydrogen sulphide fault to disappear.
  There are some modern red wines that improve after opening because they
have been so carefully protected from oxygen that they are "dumb" and need
a little time in contact with the air.
  A relatively modern myth surrounding red wine is:  "The histamines in
the wine cause headaches."  This fallacious concept was laid to rest some
years ago but it can be confidently asserted that whatever causes the headache
it is not large amounts of histamine.
  Gil Wahlquist of Botobalar Vineyards, Mudgee, puts it well:  "They complain
about the headache from the bottle of red wine forgetting that they drank
three bottles of white wine before it."
  Another myth, this time a viticultural one, is that there is some real
difference between wines in Australia labelled traminer and 
gewurtztraminer*gerwurtztraminer.  To our knowledge no commercial Australian 
wine has been made from traminer.  The traminer, correctly named sauvignon*savignon 
blanc (not to be confused with sauvignon blanc) no longer exists in Alsace, the 
great gewurtztraminer*gerwurtztraminer region.
  All the traminers and gewurtztraminers*gerwurtztraminers in Australia are 
from the same grape.  However if that great and knowledgeable 
patriarch*patriach of the Hunter, Murray Tyrrell*Tyrell, can continue to label 
chardonnay wines, we say incorrectly, as pinot chardonnay, then the traminer 
confusion is a minor sin.
  Other myths that plague the seller of wine include the confusion between
"fruit" and "sweetness", the mystical relationship between soil and quality
to the exclusion of climate and the belief that corks "breathe".  (If they
did all our wines would be oxidised).
AN INTERESTING selection of wines is available for tasting at the spring
wine festival being held at Stewart's Springwood Hotel tonight between 6
and 8 p.m.  This is the last of three opportunities for winelovers to sample
156 wines from 20 wine companies.
A VISIT to the Granite Belt at this time of year will enable the interested
wine lover to see the vines just after the point in the growth cycle known
as bud-burst.  This occurred for the earlier varieties such as pinot noir
and chardonnay in the last week in September, and should occur this week
for late varieties such as cabernet sauvignon and merlot.

<h> Bubbly adds sparkle to a vintage event </h>

ONE of the glamor events of the Queensland bridge calendar, the Dunhill
October Congress, will be held by the Duplicate Bridge Club in Brisbane
this weekend.
  The Dunhill accommodates all those basic elements which give a congress
polish and sparkle - an excellent venue at Doomben Racecourse, immaculate
organisation and impeccable direction.  More, there is generous sponsorship
and a champagne lunch.
  If you had any bridge doubts about the coming weekend, resolve them and
play in the Dunhill - congress inquiries: 262 6189.
  The Dunhill seems to be one of those congresses where I consistently do
the wrong thing and my best effort in four attempts has been a somewhat
jaded fourth.
  In keeping with my do-the-wrong-thing warm-up I have been helping opponents
to some rewarding contracts in recent congresses.
Dealer South.  All vul.
  Ross Dick opened the West hand with a strong no trump, and the bidding
quickly established a five-three spade fit.  Keith McDonald, in the East
seat, pushed the slam boat out with a bid of four no trumps and I
enthusiastically doubled with a five heart two ace reply.  If there had
been any doubts about the likely slam these were now quickly resolved for
it was unlikely that West would have any wasted values for the spade slam.
  Keith bid a confident six spades.  The heart lead was ruffed, three rounds
of trumps drawn and the only loser was a club to South's jack.  Indeed after
two top trumps had revealed the friendly three-two break in trumps, declarer
could have made all 13 tricks by playing on clubs and ruffing the fourth
round as the South hand holds four clubs and the outstanding trump.

 <h> PILGRIM OF PEACE </h>

<h> Pope's Aussie welcome </h>

THE pilgrim of peace, Pope John Paul II, was given a people's welcome to
Australia yesterday.
  It was a welcome of cheers, prayers, sun hats and Eskies - a relaxed start
to the Pope's 6 1/2-day tour of Australia.
  The crowd of 1500 at Fairbairn Air Base in Canberra and the 80,000 who
waited for hours for an open air Mass were many more than those who greeted
the Pontiff in New Zealand during the weekend.
  However, the numbers were still a little below expectations of the Papal
tour organisers.
  But the welcome was as warm as the sunshine in Canberra and the 66-year-old
Pontiff responded to it.
  The Pope arrives in Brisbane this morning.
  Last night he delivered a speech at Parliament House in Canberra in which
he called for "appropriate disarmament". 
  When he went walkabout yesterday at the Fairbairn Air Base where his Air
New Zealand jet landed, the excitement was evident.
  The Pope knows how to win a crowd.
  He moved slowly, kissing, touching and blessing those lucky enough to
be close to the barrier, touching even the smallest child, ignoring no one,
though barely speaking.
  For a man who is the subject of intense scrutiny from the world press,
the Pontiff hardly seems to notice the attention he attracts.
  The banners bore the Pope's personal motto, Totus tuus (Latin for All
Yours).
  And he was.
  While the Latin words were on the banners, it was very much an Australian
occasion.
  It wouldn't have been a surprise if the Pope had been greeted with a friendly
"G'day".
  While the use of Latin was a*an slightly incongruous touch, it set the
tone for a day in which the centuries-old rituals of the Catholic Church
were played out under a blazing Australian sun.
  Incongruity at the air base when the man of peace was given a full military
welcome.
  Incongruity at the National Exhibition Centre where the solemnity of the
mass was offset by a deck chair and sun hat crowd.
  It was almost as if the Australian church was making sure that, while
its head may reside 16,000km away in the Vatican, when in Australia he
must do as the Australians do.
  When he stepped from the aircraft to the tarmac he continued his tradition
of going on his knees to kiss the ground.
  The incongruity started even then when this successor of St Peter, dressed
in a heavy white cassock reaching out to the faithful on an airforce base
which even potted pines and a red carpet could not soften.
  Welcomed by Governor General Sir Ninian and Lady Stephen, the Prime Minister
and Mrs Hawke and church leaders, the Pontiff told Australians in a 20-minute
speech he had come as a pilgrim and a friend.
  As a friend he urged people to direct their hearts to God, to find the
full explanation of human dignity; as a pilgrim he was on a journey as an
act of religious devotion.
  Then came another touch of unreality over the massive security which
surrounds him.
  The head of Vatican security, Mr Cibin Camilla, may look a little like
a nightclub bouncer, and the security men are certainly ever present, but
when the Pope gets into his bulletproof Popemobile he drives off with the
side window open.
  The Pope left the air base in his bullet-proof Popemobile to conduct an
open air Mass at the National Exhibition Centre.
  En route he drove past hundreds of supporters gathered at traffic
intersections.
  Before conducting the Mass, the Pontiff changed into the special vestments
required in a very suburban mobile home brought in for the occasion.
  During the special Mass the Pope likened the sufferings of Christ to
the pioneering efforts of early Australians.
  Earlier, at the Fairbairn air base, the Pope delivered his first speech
in Australia spelling out his message of friendship.
  Telling Australians we are a people of undoubted goodwill, he said:
  "I come as a friend; to urge you to pursue your lives all those values
worthy of a human person; to encourage you to be open hearted, generous
to the unfortunate and caring towards those who are pushed to the margins
of life.
  "Many of you follow Him in discipleship and still others of you revere
His teachings.  But whether or not you profess faith in Jesus Christ, or
talk about this faith with the language I use, I ask you to consider the
profound truth of the Fatherhood of God and the unity of all men and women
and children of God.
  "I ask you to reflect on what the world could be if people everywhere
acknowledged these truths and lived their lives in accordance with them."
  Reflecting on what we can do to help each other at home and abroad, he
said:  "We were made - all of us - for life and for love.  We need mutual
encouragement and support.  In the loving providence of God our Father,
the world is meant to provide a home for the whole human family; there is
room for everyone to live and there can be sustenance for all.  And everyone
has the right to pursue his or her destiny with dignity, and to share in
the good things that God has made available to His children."
  For Australia's estimated 3.8 million Catholics, his arrival marked only
the second Papal visit in Australia's history.
  But the 1970 Sydney visit of Pope Paul VI is likely to pale beside the
current tour.

 <h> Ceremony marks message </h>

THE world needed people prepared to sacrifice themselves for others, rather
than sacrifice others for a cause, His Holiness Pope John Paul II told the
nation's leaders last night before lighting a candle for peace.
  In the strongest and most topical of his three speeches since arriving
in Australia, the Pope stressed the theme of his visit - peace in the world
- and asserted the dignity and rights of individuals.
  He commended Australia for being a tolerant and pluralistic society but
warned:  "Justified pluralism is not to be confused with neutrality on human
values.
  In a heavily political speech, he called for "appropriate disarmament",
made a strong reference to the value of a separate Catholic education system
and delivered a broad hint on abortion.
  Speaking in Kings Hall at Parliament House for a special peace ceremony,
Pope John Paul II called on politicians to guard the right to religious freedom
and the dignity of the human person.
  "As you know, the principle of the inviolable dignity of all human beings
is an even higher principle in a democratic State than majority opinion.
  "Indeed, all democracies will eventually succeed or fail to the extent
that they truly guard and promote the human rights of all, including
minorities."  
  The Pope said the number of Catholics in Australia and their presence
in almost all areas of Australian life were an example of how religious
freedom, fundamental among freedoms, was respected here.
  "I pray that you will always ... be ever vigilant in defending the very
foundation of this right and every human right which is and will for ever
be the dignity of the human  person," he said.
  The challenge*challege was immense, His Holiness said, to promote a just society
to defend the weak and vulnerable, to eliminate racism and other
discrimination, to protect and assist the family, to find work for the
unemployed and to help all those in need.
  Australia had in the past been generous to the less fortunate of the world,
had taken a great influx of immigrants and accepted refugees, he said.
  The Pope touched briefly on one of the most contentious issues facing
Australian society, and Catholicism in particular - fertility control -
saying the only strong bases for civilisation were reverence for human life
from the moment of conception and through every stage of life.
  He said he hoped all Catholics and all other citizens would ensure that
nothing would be done by the legislature that would undermine those rights
and values.
  At the very foundation of peace were the two areas of defence of human
rights and efforts for the development of peoples.
  "As long as these elements are missing at any level, peace is imperfect
and world peace is imperilled," the Pope said.
  His Holiness then lit a two metre-high Candle of Peace in Kings Hall and
offered a prayer for peace.
  The Parliament House reception was the final event in a hectic day in
which the Pope had flown from New Zealand, celebrated Mass for more than
100,000 people at the National Exhibition Centre in Canberra and met
Governor-General Sir Ninian Stephen and Lady Stephen at Government House.

 <h> Uniform theft sparks police alert </h>

STOLEN police uniforms and a rifle may be used in an armed holdup while
attention is focussed on today's Papal visit, police warned yesterday.
  Two police shirts, a cap and a .22 rifle were stolen from the Banyo police
station on Sunday night.
  Nundah detectives believe the uniforms may be used by bandits to
impersonate police officers.
  A spokesman said the culprits may attempt the robbery while the majority
of police are on security duty for Papal tour.
  But police do not expect the stolen uniforms to pose a security risk
for the visit.
  The rifle, which did not have a firing mechanism, was not police issue.

 <h> Security shake-up as new Popemobile breaks </h>

A back-up bulletproof car will be included in the Papal procession through
Brisbane after the "indestructible" Popemobile broke down during a rehearsal
yesterday.
  The custom-built Popemobile threw a security scare into tour organisers
when its transmission failed during the rehearsal at QEII stadium.
  But the police commander for Pope John Paul II's visit, Assistant
Commissioner Ron Redmond, said it was fortunate the problem had surfaced.
  "This eventuality had been foreseen and a reserve bulletproof vehicle
will be in the escort in case the Popemobile breaks down," Mr Redmond said.
  "Mechanics have rectified the problem and the Popemobile should see out
the entire Brisbane tour."
  A massive police security operation, which includes a crack anti-terrorist
squad, swung into action yesterday in readiness for the Pope's whirlwind
visit.
  Queensland police polished security arrangements by travelling the Pope's
route with the Popemobile, police escorts and RAAF surveillance helicopters.
  The Popemobile's transmission failed after the three-tonne vehicle had
done a lap of the QEII stadium.
  A police spokesman said Sunday's Turkish consulate bombing in Melbourne
had not affected security arrangements.
  "At this stage, the bombing has nothing to do with the Papal visit and
as security levels are very high, every reasonable precaution has been
taken," he said.
  More than 800 police, including undercover officers who will mingle
with Pope-watchers, will be responsible for crowd control at Brisbane
Airport and along the route to QEII and the City Hall.
  One of the most worrying security aspects will be the Pope's blessing
of Brisbane from the City Hall balcony.
  Mr Redmond has said:  "The high-rises around the City Hall are a worry
and situations like that, when the Pope is out of his vehicle, will be covered
with the necessary weapons."
  More than 140,000 people are expected to see the Pope during his packed
six-hour visit.
  Public transport arrangements are the biggest for an event in Queensland,
with 22 extra train services and 200 buses at the ready.
  Transport Minister Mr Lane and Lord Mayor Ald Atkinson have asked people
to use public transport.
  Education Minister Mr Powell has stressed that today is not a school
holiday. 
  But parents have the option of sending their children to school.

 <h> Inner suburban values soar up to 200pc </h>

<bl> By Brett McCarthy </bl>

SOME Brisbane inner-suburban residents may face a large rates jump in the
wake of 200 to 250 per cent valuation increases.
  Valuation Minister Mr Muntz released 185,000 of the 250,000 revaluations
yesterday.
  He said the increased demand and popularity of Paddington, Red Hill and
Kelvin Grove had increased values in those areas by up to 250 per cent.
  Since the last valuation in 1979, he said, the market for residential
land had been generally flat, but land prices had risen considerably since
1979 - particularly in the early 1980s.

 <h> Case of Misdirected Prayers  </h>

  <h> MOSQUE OFF LINE </h>

  <misc> LONDON (AAP): </misc>

  The first mosque built in Rome is claimed to be five degrees
off beam and facing Tel Aviv instead of Mecca.
  The story was broken by the Italian magazine Europeo, which is being sued
for libel by architect Paolo Portoghese.
  Portoghese claims there is no problem, but Europeo is standing by its
story.
  The Muslim League, which represents all Arab nations in Rome and is paying
$59.39 million to have the mosque built, launched an inquiry today.
  Given the speed that things are done in Italy, the inquiry probably will
take up to four months to complete.
  Plans for the mosque were drawn up in 1976, but controversy over the design
caused a long delay.       
  Changes eventually were made and work began two years ago.  Now, the marble
building is half finished.  
  The mosque is being built on a slope and that is reported to be the reason
why it is off line.

<h> Double killer `still in area' </h>

<bl> By Warren Gibbs </bl>

  Police believe the Logan Reserve double murderer has gone to ground
in the area of his brutal attacks.
  Officer-in-charge Det. Sgt Neil Conway said today inquiries interstate
revealed nothing to indicate the man has fled Queensland.
  The killer, described as a*an "frenzied maniac", was capable of killing
at anytime, and police warned of the dangers of harboring the man.
  "He is callous murderer who has nothing to lose by killing again," Det.Sgt
Conway said.
  Det. Sgt Conway said inquiries were being centred on Brisbane's southside,
extending to the Gold Coast.
  Detectives have received more than 750 tip-offs from the public, but are
appealing for anyone with information to contact Beenleigh CIB.

for new tenants, Brisbane service clubs and ferry passengers.
  As part of the morning celebrations, a street theatre band sang and danced
its way through more than 200 onlookers, as a hot air balloon hovered.
  Later, people were treated to a display by a team of 12 parachutists and
a waterski show on the Brisbane River.
  Interstate architects are expected at the celebrations to see Brisbane's
tallest building, which is rated as one of the most technically advanced
in Australia.
  The 147m tower contains Brisbane's state-of-the-art stock exchange, which
began operations in August after 20 years at Network House in Queen Street.
  The centre also has Brisbane's latest "eateries", including Michael's
Restaurant and its $1 million wine cellar.
  On Sunday, the Great Ferry Boat Race starts at 11.30am from the Regatta

 <h> CROC VICTIM GENTLE MAN - MOTHER </h>

<bl> By Neil Doorley </bl>

  The mother of a Queensland man, who was taken by a crocodile in the Gulf
of Carpentaria, said today:  "No one deserves to die like that.
  "What happened to my son was dreadful.  He was such a gentle, caring person."
  Mrs Elaine Whereat, 68, of Bundaberg, yesterday identified the man taken
by a 4.5m crocodile as he slept on a river bank at Rocky Creek Landing,
Borrooloola, about 700km south-east of Darwin, on September 7, as her son,
Edward Jeffrey Whereat, 39.
  Darwin police had been trying to contact relatives, and released photographs
of Mr Whereat to newspapers "as a last resort".
  Mr Whereat, whose remains were found in the crocodile two days after he
disappeared, travelled under four different names, but commonly was known
as Lee McLeod.
  His legs were found 100m from where he was attacked.
  Mrs Whereat, a pensioner, said her son's remains probably would be buried
in the Northern Territory this week.  She and her son and daughter could
not afford to attend the funeral.
  "I hadn't seen Edward for 14 years when I found this had happened," Mrs
Whereat said.  She recognised a photograph of her son in a morning newspaper.

 <h> Parson trial stalls </h>

  <misc> LONDON (AAP): </misc>

  A worldwide hunt for a missing witness brought an abrupt
halt to the trial of a self-styled international evangelist accused of drugging
and raping devout young Christian virgins in his flock.
  Discharging an Old Bailey jury of nine men and three women who have spent
the last two weeks hearing the alleged victims give evidence against the
57-year old South African-born preacher, Judge Nina Lowry said: "It's no-one's
fault."
  She explained that despite "intensive inquiries" a witness wanted by the
defence had not been found.  But there were hopes she could be located within
the next*new few weeks.
  She told the jury: "I can't keep you waiting here for a few weeks.  The
defence have applied for more time for justice to be done, they shall have
that opportunity."
  "Time and money have been spent which is regrettable, and will have to
be again.  It's no-one's fault, but I can't risk the defence being
disadvantaged.  I reluctantly have to discharge you from giving verdicts
in this case."
  The aborted trial is thought to have cost more than $115,400 including
the expenses of two witnesses flown from Australia.  A new trial is expected
to start in January.
  Prosecution have alleged that while on an evangelical crusade in Queensland,
the preacher drugged a 14-year old schoolgirl and, while pretending to
pray at her bedside, put his hands under the blankets and indecently assaulted
her.  Also that he raped her at her outback home while her parents slept.

  The Bureau of Air Safety Investigation has begun an inquiry into the mid-air
incident.
  The pilot was commanding a freight operations flight to Brisbane on

  "We are fully aware of the incident and have begun a thorough investigation.
  "For some reason the pilot failed to report his position but there was
no actual danger involved."
  The pilot, who landed the plane without incident, has been grounded while
the investigation is carried out.
  Airline authorities believe he may have experienced a technical breakdown,
but have not ruled out the possibility he could have fallen asleep at the

<h> Warning on PIN code safeguards </h>

<bl> By Deirdre Williams </bl>

  A warning that bank customers should not keep their PIN code to automatic
teller machines with their cash card has been issued by Consuming Interest,
the quarterly journal of the Australian Consumers Association.
  It seems about 50 percent of customers keep their code number, often
disguised as a telephone number, with their card.
  The publication said banks might consider this practice to be a breach
of conditions of use.  The customer could be left liable for unauthorised
use of the card.
  Difficulties with security of PINs (personal identification numbers)
was just one of the problems related to electronic funds transfer systems,
which were highlighted in a recent ACA survey.
  The survey showed that many consumers had suffered financial loss or
inconvenience due to EFTS.
  Other problems included errors and account statement inaccuracies; "phantom"
or unauthorised transactions; outright fraud; and mistakes in the amount
of cash disbursed from electronic terminals.
  Consuming Interest described cases where consumers had found their
accounts debited twice for the same purchase, or discovered transactions
caused by someone else being issued with an identical card.
  One consumer had two separate withdrawal transactions for $100 disrupted
with no money received, but the account was debited for the $200 and it
took six months and a written complaint to get the account rectified.
  Other cases involved excessively delayed transfer of funds, with one
person's wages remaining inaccessible for six weeks.
  "These problems result from accounting procedures whereby transaction
requests are recorded without verification that the cash was dispensed,
or the account credited," the magazine said.
  It said the system appeared designed to protect the financial institution
- while the consumer bore the risks.
  The Australian Consumer Association has called on the Federal Government
to make urgent reforms.
  The association wants legislation to ensure uniform codes of practice
and rights and responsibilities of all parties clearly specified; better
advice to consumers on methods of securing the PIN code, with all consumer
liability or losses ending automatically once the card has been reported
lost or stolen; and a formal system of investigating errors.
  The association also is pressing for the establishment of a tribunal
to resolve any disputes.

 <h>10 hurt in ferry mishap </h>

<bl> From Neil Evans in Sydney </bl>

  Ten people were injured - two seriously - when a ferry crashed into a
wharf on Sydney Harbor today.
  The modern government ferry was returning from Taronga Park Zoo with 80
passengers when it struck the No.5 wharf near Circular Quay about 12.10pm.
  The two seriously injured are believed to be suffering from spinal
injuries.
  An Urban Transit Authority spokesman said the ferry appeared to
malfunction.  Damage had been caused to the vessel's bow.
  He said it would be out of action until a full damage report had been
completed.
  The incident was not related to the numerous visiting warships in the
harbor for the Royal Australian Navy's 75th Birthday celebrations.

 The "Mighty Mo" - the USS Missouri - sailed into Sydney Harbor today
accompanied by hordes of vessels celebrating its arrival.
  As the 45,000 tonne warship sailed through the Heads and towards its
mooring place, smaller boats greatly outnumbering protest boats, hovered
around it.
  The Missouri reached the dock shortly after 8.30am amid little incident
from some anti-nuclear protesters who had gathered on the harbor to
demonstrate against its arrival.
  The ship is here for the Royal Australian Navy's 75th birthday celebrations
along with 40 other naval ships from seven countries.
  A spokesman on board the Missouri said:  "It was a dream come true" to
bring the historic warship Down Under.
  Four tugs met the Missouri at the Heads before accompanying her safely
to its mooring.  The port emergency tug led the warship up the harbor 
with all her fire hoses at work.

in their battle for community support by putting their cases to the public.
  The Royal Australian Nursing Federation released a negotiating document

  Meanwhile, the number of hospitals hit by mass walkouts is set to reach
34 with the addition of Royal Southern Memorial yesterday, Goulburn Valley

 <h> Markets react calmly to record deficit </h>

<misc> CANBERRA -</misc>

 A record current account deficit for October highlights the
pressure on the Federal Government's strategy to slow down the economy without
creating a full recession.
  With a deficit of $1735m, Australia continued to suck in more than $3000
worth of imports in October despite a 12 p.c. drop on the September figure.
  But, while the Opposition said the result was a disgrace, the financial
markets reacted calmly with the dollar and interest rates remaining steady.
  The Opposition Leader, Mr Howard, said the result proved the Government's
economic policies had failed miserably.
  But the Treasurer, Mr Keating, told Parliament the figure was "in the
groove" with Budget expectations.
  The October result showed that while the overall deficit rose $262m on
the September figure, Australia's trading position improved dramatically
in seasonally adjusted terms.
  The deficit on the balance of merchandised trade increased by $185m to
$253m, with regular imports continuing the downward trend that has been
evident in the economy since late last year.
  Government sources said they were more than happy with the deficit because
it was at the "very bottom of everybody's expectations".
  The trade account "should come back, but there won't be any dramatic
progress". 
  The Government's sails are set for early next year when it expects the
current account to pick up and start to move towards a trade surplus.
  Yesterday's figures were influenced by a number of adverse factors, including
the importation of $139m worth of aircraft parts by Qantas, Australian Airlines
and Ansett.
  Other seasonal difficulties included massive interest payments from
the public and private sectors and the quarterly foreign aid payments, and
the seasonal trade movements which work against any upturn in exports against
imports.
  Government sources say that with the regular imports - those not including
one-off items such as defence materials, aircaft and fuel - falling, there
is now growing evidence that Australian industry is engaging in import
replacement.  
  However, the Opposition has charged that Mr Keating had said
12 months ago that the trade deficit would begin to improve and this had
not happened.
  "There is not one individual, not one family, not one business that can
now possibly say that they feel they are better off under Hawke Government
than they were 3 1/2 years ago," Mr Howard said.
  He said Australia did not need a recession to stop the inflow of imports.
 Instead investment needed to be encouraged.
  "The great failure of the Government's economic strategy is that it believes
that all you have to do in order to encourage people to invest in exports
or manufacturing is to take advantage of the price benefits of a
depreciation," he said.
  "Yet in reality the things that will make people invest are lower taxes
and lower interest rates."
  Mr Keating said the October figures had caused hardly a flicker on the
Reuter screens which show the movements in the value of the Australian dollar.
  The dollar closed yesterday at US64.58c, the same as it closed on Wednesday,
and the trade weighted index, where the dollar is measured against a basket
of currencies, finished slightly stronger at 54.1.

<h> Police group wants unions to join push for changes to Act </h>

  The SA Police Association will invite other unions - covering prisons,
fire and ambulance services - to make a joint approach to the State Government
to amend the Criminal Injuries Compensation Act.
  The association has already met the Deputy Premier, Mr Hopgood, on the
matter but has not received an official response.
  The action has arisen following the decision by the Attorney-General,
Mr Sumner, to use the $10,000 compensation awarded to an injured Whyalla
policeman to pay part of his $13,000 medical bill.
  Constable Adrian Burnett was shot in the face during a siege in January.
  Fragments of the .22 calibre bullet shattered his front teeth and palate
and eventually lodged in his throat near his spine.
  He underwent operations and more than six months of rehabilitation before
being able to return to work.
  The Police Assocation has been incensed by Mr Sumner's action.
  The secretary of the association, Mr Dan Brophy, said the committee of
SAPA had met and decided to use every possible legal avenue to clear up the
Act and its interpretation.
  He said he knew of three cases where police officers had been injured
in the line of duty and had not been awarded compensation under the Act.
  At present the Attorney-General has discretionary powers to channel
compensation payment made under the Act towards the payment of costs such
as medical bills.
  A spokesman for the Attorney-General's office said the purpose of the
Criminal Injuries Compensation Act was to provide compensation only where
there was no other compensation available.
  He said Const. Burnett had received payments from worker's compensation
and payments under the Act were only to be used as a last resort.
  In a Letter to the Editor in yesterday's Advertiser, the wife of another
police officer revealed her husband had also been denied the proper
compensation.  
  Her husband, Detective Sergeant Graem Lawton of the Elizabeth CIB, lost
more than 90 p.c. of the vision of his left eye in 1981 after a glass was
thrust into his face while working for the drug squad.
  The Attorney-General's spokesman said Det.-Sgt Lawton was not eligible
for compensation under the Criminal Injuries Compensation Act but was eligible
for a lump sum payment under the Worker's Compensation Act for his permanent
disability.
 Under the Act, the loser of an eye is entitled to $10,000 but no such
application had been received from Det.-Sgt Lawton.
  Det.-Sgt Lawton said yesterday that it was his understanding that if
he took the lump sum payment he would not be eligible for any further payments
if his sight deteriorated.
  He said public servants were being discriminated against as payments of
up to $10,000 were not unusual for rape victims and relatives of murder
victims.
  Between January 4, 1986, and November 4, 1986, there had been 225 payouts
from the Criminal Injury Compensation Act totalling $1,007,952.53.

<h> Ombudsman criticises Minister </h>

<misc> CANBERRA - </misc>

 The Commonwealth Ombudsman has attacked the Minister for Finance,
Senator Walsh, the Federal Government and Parliament for threatening his
effectiveness.
  Mr G. Kolts, QC, says in his 1985-86 annual report that an insidious threat
to the implementation of Ombudsman's recommendations tentatively identified
last year "gained serious substance in 1985-86."
  He says Senator Walsh's frequent rejection of recommended compensation
payments poses a substantial threat to his ability to provide meaningful
remedies for complainants financially disadvantaged by defective
administration.
  He also says some of his functions will be neglected and it will be a
"struggle for the Ombudsman to hold his own" unless staffing in his office
is increased.
  And he says the trend of Parliament to take no action on special Ombudsman
reports to it also threatens his effectiveness.
  Mr Kolts says that during 1985-86 there was an unprecedented number of
cases in which he had to report to the Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, because
a Government agency had not given effect to a recommendation from him.
  "With two exceptions, the stumbling block has been the refusal of the
Minister for Finance to approve an act of grace payment to the complainant,"
he says.
  Mr Kolts says that in refusing the payments, Senator Walsh opposed
recommendations of both the Ombudsman and the agency responsible for the
administrative defect.
  He says that a special Ombudsman's report to Parliament has hitherto
seemed to be an effective deterrent to arbitrary or ill-considered rejections
of his recommendations.
  But it is unlikely the reports will long continue to be such a deterrent
"if Parliament omits to take any constructive interest in them".
  Mr Kolts says neither of his two reports to Parliament during the year
elicited any debate or substantive comment despite the fact that both
raised issues of public interest.
  He says that in 1985-86 his office received 3750 written complaints -
400 more than the previous year - and more than 17,000 oral complaints 
- Paul Willoughby

 Amendments to the State Government's Beverage Containers Act were approved
by Executive Council yesterday ending plans to lift deposits for non-refillable
beverage bottles from 5c to 15c.
  Non-returnable containers will now attract a deposit of 6c, compared with
the 4c deposit on returnable containers.
  The amendments were introduced when the Government found it could not
justify the planned 15c deposit after being challenged by the Bond Brewing
Company in court.
  A spokesman for the Minister of Environment and Planning, Dr Hopgood,

such a large differential between returnable and one-way containers under
Section 92 of the Constitution which related to free trade between States.

<h> A `pensioner's burial' for key Soviet figure </h>

 <misc> MOSCOW, Thursday -</misc>

 One of the key shapers of Soviet history, Vyacheslav
Molotov, was buried at a Moscow cemetery yesterday after a discreet funeral
described by a Foreign Ministry official as "a private burial for a pensioner".
  Mr Molotov, 96, died on Saturday.  An organiser of the 1917 Bolshevik
revolution, he worked at the centre of Kremlin power throughout the Stalin
era but later fell into disgrace and was ejected from the Communist Party.
  Although denied an official funeral, Mr Molotov was buried at the Novodevichy
cemetery, second in prestige only to the Kremlin.  This reflected Mr Molotov's
readmission to the party two years ago.
  One party Central Committee member was present at the burial, attended
by relatives and friends.
  Six busloads of mourners arrived at the cemetery, protected by police
who kept onlookers and journalists away.  One of the buses, its windows draped
in black, drove in through the massive green gates of the cemetery ramparts.
  Cemetery officials said Mr Molotov was to be buried next to his wife, Polina
Zhemchuzhina, who died in 1967 after surviving years in labor camps under
Kremlin dictator Josef Stalin.  Mr Molotov is said to have signed her arrest
warrant.
  The plot lies near the site where Stalin's wife, Nadezhda Alliluyeva,
was buried in 1932 after committing suicide.
  It is a good distance from the grave of Nikita Krushchev, who ousted Mr
Molotov from the party leadership in 1957.
  One elderly man in a crowd of onlookers said he had come to pay his last
respects but had not been allowed inside.  He was clutching a bouquet of
purple chrysanthemums and wore a bronze medal of Stalin.
  "Molotov made a few mistakes.  He was in the anti-party group," declared
the man, who said he worked in the Soviet defence industry and was not a
Communist Party member.

 <h> A child's portion of service </h>

Eating out with children is a necessary part of their overall education.
 And while the Australian tradition is that kids should be neither seen nor
heard outside fast-food outlets, some restaurants do their best to make children
welcome.
  Children need to be introduced to the pleasures of eating out as part
of their social education.  They need to visit restaurants and learn the
art of behaving in a public eating place.  The need to know how to read and
understand a menu and to order from it, and to discover the pleasure of eating
foods more sophisticated than they are served at home.  They need to know
how to be polite customers and at the same time to be aware of the consumer
rights of diners.
  If children eat out with their parents regularly, or only occasionally,
they will be secure about going to restaurants when they begin to dine
out with friends.
  But do restaurants really welcome children as part of the family group
and tomorrow's patrons?  Obviously, there are some silver-service restaurants
which are not designed for child customers, mostly because the 
extended nature of the meals.  A small child could not be expected to sit 
through a four-hour dinner.
  However, parents cannot hope to teach their children restaurant manners
if they are restricted to going only to hamburger, pizza or fast-food outlets.
  Four journalists who are parents of young children were asked to road
test a few local restaurants to see how welcome their children were and
how the staff coped with the child customers.
  JOHN Brittle took his daughters Marie-Lorraine, 8 and Catherine, 4 to
Fasta Pasta in Pirie Street, city:
  We got off to a good start at Fasta Pasta.  We were barely in the restaurant
before a cheerful Italian chucked one of the girls under the chin and said:
"Hello, beautiful".
  I thought we might be swamped with attention just as parents - or a parent
- with kids usually are treated in restaurants in Italy and most Latin
countries.  But we weren't overwhelmed.  We were underwhelmed.
  There was plenty of room and we took a table against a wall.
  We lined up, selected and ordered.
  Helping the kids make their selection from a blackboard they couldn't read,
and hoisting the little one up to see the salads, took a little time. 
  There were few other patrons so the delay didn't really matter.  But there
was no help from the staff as I would have received in Rome, Madrid or Buenos
Aires.
  The bread was excellent and thick-cut and the two hungry kids loved it.
  The antipasto was so-so and half of it was left uneaten.  The children
love spaghetti and dug into the steaming plates with Bolognaise sauce.
  I had to help the younger one.  At home we usually cut up her spaghetti
so she can eat it with a spoon.
  None of the staff, who were passing to and fro, offered to cut it up or
made any move to help.  I had to lean across the table to wind each forkful
for her.  We managed.  We had to ask twice for more paper napkins to clean
up faces and the table.
  The children couldn't finish the spaghetti, but like all kids somehow
found room for ice-cream, in this case, cassata.
  I was disappointed in the rather offhand service.  We had to ask for
everything.  No-one came to see whether we wanted anything or to ask how
the food was - and for part of the time there were more staff in the restaurant
than customers.
  On the positive side, the "child's portions" were too big for my kids to
handle.  The hot food was hot.
  And the kids rated the spaghetti "excellent".  As we left one said: "Don't
mention another word about food".  There was certainly no skimping on serves.
But the offhandedness of the staff I find curious.
  I recall many nights in Italy, Spain and Argentina - where the population
is about half Italian - seeing in restaurants families, with small kids,
with the the kids on highchairs being thoroughly spoilt by waiters giving
them their own menus, napkins, drinks and food, cutting it for them and
generally making a fuss of them.
  Usually, walking into a restaurant with kids in those countries assures
a rush of attention.  That's why I thought we were off to a good start at
Fasta Pasta.  Perhaps we prefer to be left alone when we eat out - even
with the kids.
  But give me the Latin attitude any time.
  Children are considered part of the regular clientele, especially on Fridays
and Saturdays, said partner of Fasta Pasta, Enrico Siano.  "However sometimes
I have to ask parents to watch their children, as with all the hot dishes
moving about I am concerned there may be an accident."
  This is a report by Jamie Goode, aged 14 months, as told to his mother:
  Going to restaurants can be a drag when you're only 14 months old.  At
Mount Lofty House, the maitre d smiled rather strangely at my parents 
and me when we arrived.
  He seated us in a cramped corner, next to the swinging kitchen door, and
then pretended we didn't exist, even though he kept stumbling over my pram.
  We waited for more than 40 minutes for Devonshire tea, while later arrivals
were served.
  My parents kept wheeling me around the gardens during the wait. After a
while that became very boring.  Finally, we gave up and went home.  By then
I was tired, cranky and starving.
  But a recent visit to the Botanic Gardens Restaurant was much nicer.
The manager greeted us with a big, friendly grin and seated us at a table
with lots of room.  He put me in a highchair so I could look out the picture
windows.  I really enjoyed looking outside and watching the birds flying
overhead and the children playing in the gardens.
  The waitress was also very nice.  She took our order right away and promptly
brought us glasses of orange juice.  She also gave us several napkins and
said: "Just let me know if you need any more.  I know how it is."  I wonder
what she meant by that?
  Mummy and Daddy helped themselves to the salad bar and shared their portions
with me.  I liked the tomatoes, lettuce, potato salad, biscuits and cheese.
  My parents ordered the grilled whiting and the Wiener schnitzel for
the main course.  The fish was grilled to perfection.  Unfortunately, the
schnitzel was a bit tough and oily.  After a few tentative bites, I tossed
it into the air.
  It made the most satisfactory thud when it hit the ground.
  By the end of the meal there was a fine litter of food scattered about
my highchair.  I really don't know how it happened but it was most decorative.
 My parents started clearing up, but the manager told them not to trouble
themselves.
  "Don't worry, we'll take care of it," he said in a relaxed, assuring manner.
  He even complimented me on my table manners.  Another first for my family.
  Families are clearly welcome.  On another visit, we saw a group of mums
and bubs having lunch.  The waitress was very attentive and helpful - heating
bottles, serving requested child's portions, and providing napkins.
  I can hardly wait to go again.
  Mount Lofty House Restaurant does not actively encourage children as guests,
said the director, Janet Sands.  "We have no highchairs, no child menus,
no real facilities for children.  If they arrive we accommodate them as
well as we can.  However, we are quite adaptable.
  The management of the Botanic Gardens Restaurant welcomes children, but
expects parents to keep them under control to the extent of not disturbing
other diners.
  Samela Harris, has two sons, 13 and 7, who are regular diners out.  Their
favorite outing is to a Chinese restaurant:
  Sam, aged 7, is well-travelled and used to restaurants.  In his carry-cot
he enjoyed some of Europes's most illustrious restaurants.  But that is
Europe where babies are part of life and children are people.  
  Because ritzy Australian restaurants are terribly precious about their
exclusivity, few parents would dare to take their young in case of sneers
from maitre ds.  We have been conditioned to believe that junk-food eateries
are where one takes children and gourmet restaurants are for appreciative
adults.    
  Sam is not beyond the odd hamburger but he prefers real food and loves
to eat good Chinese cuisine.  Honey prawns in sesame are a passion with him.
  Fortunately the Chinese have not caught up with the Australian attitude
towards children.  They have high-chairs for babies and marvellous lazy
susans to entrance older children.  They have wide varieties of food to
please everyone from the fastidious to the adventurous.
  Sam has eaten yum cha in most of the restaurants which serve it on Sundays.
  The Dynasty in Gouger Street, is his favorite.  His odd jocularity that
the chicken feet are like ET's hands are not taken askance by the Chinese
staff, although they may have no idea what he is on about.  But their innate
good manners make them respond with interest to his comments and sheer
delight that an Aussie kid is devouring chicken feet at all.
  When the adults are still chatting on and finishing the wine, the Chinese
staff are not perturbed that Sam wanders over to chat with them or scrutinise
the fish tanks.  He, like the many Chinese children who go for yum cha,
is very welcome - and made to feel so.
  Sunday's a really family day at the Dynasty Restaurant, said proprietor
Peter Ng, but the restaurant welcomes children and family groups at any
time.
  Rosemary Clark has two children, Neil, 9, and Terri, 7:
  The culinary tastes of Neil and his sister are oceans apart.
  Neil is a pasta-lover and would twirl his fork around spaghetti at every
dining-out opportunity.
  It may be a little harder for him to twirl his tongue around the names
of some Italian dishes - but that does not stop him from ordering cappelleti
alla panna or spaghetti amatriciana from his favorite Italian restaurant.
  The easy-going atmosphere and plain, solid furnishings in most Italian
eateries ideally suit the sometimes less-than-genteel table manners of young
diners.  
  Chinese food is Terri's delight.  Honey chicken is top of the list, with
chicken chop suey coming a close second.  In fact, anything containing
chicken meets with her approval.
  On days when compromise is not in Neil and Terri's vocabulary the
International Food Plaza at the Central Market is the answer. 
  It is a place where the taste for twirling spaghetti and finger-licking
spring rolls mix.  Families can enjoy, not just endure, a trip to a restaurant.
  Dining out should be a fun, learning experience for children, so parents
should choose the venue carefully.
  Staff in Chinese restaurants invariably make youngsters feel both important
and wanted.  Dropping a chopstick on the ground is not considered a clanger,
and the occasional spilt drink is cleared up without a fuss.
  Peter Westgarth is a 29-year-old bachelor.
  He has not enjoyed the proximity of noisy, ill-behaved children in restaurants
and says the maxim which states children should be seen and not heard is overdue
for re-writing.
  He suggests something such as: "Keep 'em quiet and teach 'em right".
  He thinks that these days, too many parents seem prepared to let their
children do whatever they like.

<h> GUARD ON CHILD ABUSE PARENTS  </h>

<misc> SYDNEY: </misc>

 The couple who allegedly neglected their young sons over a two-year
period have been given protection in jail.
  Authorities fear Donald Richard Capetti, 39, and his wife, Robyn Francis
Cappetti, 41, will be attacked by other prisoners outraged at the allegations
of abuse against their sons, 4 and 2.
  The Cappettis are each charged with three counts of inflicting grievous
bodily harm on two of their five children.
  Police discovered the children when they investigated a fire at the Cappettis'
home in Werrington, on Saturday night. 
  Darren, 4, weighed only 11kg when he was found tied to a door by a length
of rope.
  His brother, David, 2, was found in a filthy state, weighing only 12kg.
  Police alleged Darren had cockroach infestations in his nappy and his
stomach had been scalded by urine.
  He had been tied to a door and had slept on a urine-soaked foam mattress
for two years.
  His right foot had become gangrenous.
  David had allegedly suffered scalding from wearing wet nappies for too
long.
  Penrith Court was told the two children had not been washed for two months
and their fingers and toes had stuck together with grime.
  Police alleged they were not fed at times for up to five days.
  A spokesman for the Corrective Services Minister, Mr Akister, said the
Cappittis had been given protective custody for their own safety.
  Mr Cappetti has been held at Parklea maximum security prison while Mrs
Cappetti is being detained at Silverwater Prison.
  "It is normal procedure to offer prisoners associated with child-related
crimes protective custody," the spokesman said.
  "In some cases we give them protective custody straight away.  The Cappettis
willingly accepted it.

<h> Bear bites off boy's arm </h>

<misc> LONDON: </misc>

 A bear in a Scottish wildlife park last night bit off and devoured
the arm of a boy, 10.
  Police said Ross Prendergast, who also was mauled on the chest and shoulders,
put his arm into the bear's cage after he, his brother, and some friends climbed
two fences to reach it.
  The 227kg European brown bear, Jeremy, well known for his appearances in
Sugar Puffs commercials in the 1960s, is a star attraction at the Camperdown
Wildlife Centre, Dundee.
  The park was closed when the incident happened at 8 o'clock.
  Staff heard the boy's screams and rushed to help him.  Prendergast was taken
to the town's royal infirmary, where he was given emergency surgery.
  His condition was described as satisfactory.
  A hospital spokesman said his right arm had been bitten off just below
the elbow.
  The fence surrounding Jeremy's cage was 1.55 metres high.
  Prendergast's grandfather said: "He's a brave wee laddie.  He's really
quite perky.  I'm sure he'll bounce back.
  The attack was the second in 48 hours at the wildlife centre.  Earlier,
a man had been bitten by a wolf.
  Ross, his brother, Mark and six of their friends had slipped through the
fence into the centre shortly after closing time.
  Employee Angad Taha was trying to round up the children when he heard
frantic screams from the bear's enclosure.
  A stick was found nearby and officials believe Prendergast might have
been taunting the bear, described by the centre as "just a big softie.
  Mr Taha, who gave emergency first aid, was too shocked to speak about
the incident.
  A spokesman for the district council, which licenses the centre, said
he did not think the bear would be put down.
  However, an urgent inquiry has been ordered.

<h> Twin's death saves David </h>

<misc> LOS ANGELES: </misc>

 An infant whose life was spared when doctors removed his doomed
twin brother from the womb has been born three months premature.
  David Moller was delivered by caesarean section and is in a critical
but stable condition at Northridge Hospital Medical Centre.
  David, who weighed 1.72 kg at birth, suffered from a condition caused
by excess body fluid.
  About 113 grams of fluid was removed from his abdomen and the rest dissipated
dropping David's weight to 0.95kg.
  David's brother was removed from the womb after he had withered to half
David's size.
  Doctors said David would probably have died if they had not removed his
brother.

 Australia has launched its new gold bullion coin, the Australian
Nugget, on the world market in the first sanctions salvo against South Africa's
Kruggerand.
  However, in carving up the lucrative bullion market at a time of peak
gold prices, the Australian Nugget will compete against Canada's Maple

<h> Sexy Tina to boogie with little Princes. </h>

 <misc> LONDON: </misc>

 Prince William and his baby brother Harry are to have a special
private dance teacher ...
...rock'n'roll's sexiest grandmother, Tina Turner.
  The unprecedented Royal invitation from Prince Charles followed a back-stage
meeting where, Tina says, Charles told her she had the best legs he had seen.
  "I was completely flabbergasted," she said.
  Tina, 46, the powerhouse singer who taught Mick Jagger to dance, met Charles
and Di after a concert in London.
  "They sent me a lovely picture of their boys playing in the garden," she
said.
  "But there was also a letter from Charles.
  "It suggested I should get along to the palace and help Diana give little
William and Henry some dancing lessons.
  "I was utterly bowled over - but totally thrilled.
  "So I wrote back a note saying: "Thank you, Sir - I'll get your boys to
boogie.'
  The living room of my home in Los Angeles if full of gold discs, music
awards and Grammy statuettes - but that picture of the little Princess is
in pride of place on my main wall.
  "I'm sure Diana is doing a fantastic job herself teaching the boys - I
felt she had such style and grace when I met her." 
  Tina, who had a smash hit with the record, Private Dancer, said the night
of the star-studded Prince's trust show was incredible.
  I'd just sung Let It Be with Paul McCartney live on stage in front of
thousands of fans, including some of the Royal family, and I honestly thought
that was going to be the biggest thrill of my life," she said.
  "I've always admired Paul and when he came up to me backstage and asked
if I'd sing on stage with him I was delighted.
  "We used old Beatles numbers a lot in the Ike and Tina Turner revue so I
knew the words by heart.
  "But just an hour later I found myself chatting away to Prince Charles
and his lovely wife as if we were old friends."

<h> Mini-TV series on Barlow case </h>

A Sydney-based film production company is to make a television mini-series
on the Barlow-Chambers hangings.
  The fledgling company, Roadshow Coote and Carroll Pty Ltd, will start work
on the series in May 1987.
  Company director, former Adelaide film producer Mr Matt Carroll, said
today the mini-series would aim to capture the "personal side" of the two
hanged men.
  It would portray the complete story from their arrest to the subsequent
hangings.
  Kevin Barlow, 28, of Adelaide, and Geoffrey Chambers, 29, of Perth, were
hanged in a Malaysian jail last month after being found guilty of possessing
179g of heroin. 
  Mr Carroll said the case had "all the ingredients to be an excellent
mini-series." 
  "An extremely large number of people in Australia followed the case in
its entirety," he said.   
  "It commanded a very large audience on television and in the Press, so
this is a natural move.   
  "It will be a very fast-moving and dramatic series if it goes ahead."
  The mini-series was still in the early research stages to establish its
viability.
  "At present we are gathering information to work out what direction we
will take," he said.
  "We intend to start casting early next year and full production in May.

 <h> Mall to celebrate its 10th birthday </h>

WHEN Rundle Mall was officially opened almost a decade ago it was described as
one of the "most dramatic developments" our city has seen.
  It was a $1.2 million development which saw Adelaide's busiest shopping
area transformed from a traffic jammed pedestrian nightmare into a shoppers'
paradise.
  As the then Premier, Mr Dunstan, declared the mall open on September 1,
1976 champagne flowed from the famous Gawler Pl fountain, hundreds of balloons
were released and "Mall maids" gave away daffodils and shopping bags.
  Today Rundle Mall is one of the State's top tourist attractions and an

and more than 800 retailers.
  Next month a host of festivities in the mall will celebrate its 10th

 <h> Mel Gibson to star in Pine Gap film </h>

 Aussie screen heart-throb Mel Gibson will star in an Australian
movie based on the controversial U.S. defence base, Pine Gap.
  Gibson, in Los Angeles where he is filming Lethal Weapon with Danny Glover,
told industry insiders his next movie would be the Geoff Burrowes - John
Dixon film, tentatively called Maralinga.
  Gibson joins fellow superstar Jack Thompson in the cast - the first time
the two Australians will have worked together in a movie.
  Gibson will play an investigative journalist who vanishes after researching
the top secret defence outpost near Alice Springs.
  Gibson is currently playing a Vietnam veteran turned cop in the thriller
Lethal Weapon, his fourth American movie.
  Gibson, a big star in the U.S., rose to fame with the Mad Max movies.
  He then played Fletcher Christian in The Bounty, and starred opposite
Diane Keaton in Mrs Soffel and Sissy Spacek in The River.
  Gibson's Australian-made movies include the critically acclaimed The Year
Of Living Dangerously, directed by Oscar nominee Peter Weir, and Gallipoli

 Engineers have developed a new solid rocket engine design to prevent
a failure like the one that caused the explosion on the Space Shuttle
Challenger.  A U.S. Space Agency official said a team at the Marshall Space
Flight Centre in Alabama had settled on the new design in a major step towards
returning the Shuttle to flight.
  Challenger exploded on January 28 killing all seven crew members, after
a joint in its solid rocket booster failed.
  The Shuttle fleet was grounded until the rocket design flaw could be
corrected.  
  The Rogers Commission, which investigated the accident, said
two O-rings in the rocket engine joint had failed to seal, allowing superheated
gases to burn through the wall of a propellent tank.
  Fuel and oxidiser from the tank ignited, causing the explosion.

<h> Matron will stay, rules Taylor </h>

THE row between the Health Minister, Mr Taylor, and Gnowangerup Hospital
Board over Matron Ruth Griffiths reached a new pitch yesterday.
   Mr Taylor decided to scrap plans for a tribunal inquiry into her
unexplained sacking and ordered her reinstatement.
  But hospital board chairman John Humphreys last night said that the board
would stick by its decision.
  Mr Taylor said that he was angry at the hospital board's rejection of
what he called his "last-ditch attempt" to resolve the dispute.
  He condemned the board's rejection and said that its "absolute intransigence"
was astounding.
  The Minister's decision follows his efforts to mediate since the board
decided to sack the matron several weeks ago.
  At first, Mr Taylor said that he had not been given valid reasons for her
dismissal and asked the board to reinstate her.
  The board's refusal - and an outcry from Gnowangerup residents complaining
of past doctor-matron clashes - resulted in the Minister's tribunal plan.
  He had proposed a three-member tribunal, perhaps involving the nurses,
union, the Australian Medical Association and an independent chairman.
  Mr Taylor said that Matron Griffiths and the nurses' union agreed but
the board refused.
  "The absolute intransigence  of the board is astounding - especially
as the matron is willing to participate," he said.
  He now had no choice but to go ahead and reinstate Matron Griffiths -
who was surprised by the news last night.
  She said that she was still awaiting a date to return to the hospital
and until then she was "keeping busy."
  The Minister said he did not want to sack the hospital board but its
membership would be thrown open tomorrow night at the hospital's annual
general meeting .
  Mr Humphreys said the Minister's claim that the board had acted
intransigently was "ridiculous."
  "The Minister does not know the facts," he said.  
  "He does not know the reasons behind the sacking."
  He said that the reasons had been revealed only to the board's lawyer
and he disputed Mr Taylor's power to reinstate the matron.
 "Only the Government has that power," he said.
 Mr Humphreys said that the board had opposed a tribunal inquiry because
it was on the condition that it withdrew the matron's dismissal notice.
  "I feel we have the support of the town and that we should stand by our
actions," Mr Humphreys said.
  The controversy surrounding Matron Griffiths came to a head earlier
this year when the Medical Board cleared a former Gnowangerup hospital doctor,
Terence Gould, of misconduct charges brought by the matron.
  She first made headlines in 1978 when the town's GP of 20 years, Dr Alec
Winrow, resigned and moved away after reporting difficulties with the
matron.
  In 1985 a rift emerged with the town GP, Dr Peter Cummins, who in December
referred his patients to Katanning Hospital, 60km away.

 <h> Black ban could kill Cwlth, says Hayden  </h>

<misc> CANBERRA: </misc>

  The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Hayden, said yesterday that
the Commonwealth might collapse unless Britain took some tough action against
South Africa.
  Mr Hayden told the Channel Nine programme "Sunday" that many Commonwealth
countries, including Australia, were worried by the split between Britain
and the African Commonwealth countries over economic sanctions.
  He said there was a strong chance that the boycott of the Edinburgh
Commonwealth Games by four African nations could point to a further breakdown
in Commonwealth relations.
  "I think that the risk is very real and very large," he said.
  "There is a fear that the Commonwealth could unravel badly if Britain
fails to respond to the expectations of black Africa that there should be
action against South Africa."
  Mr Hayden said that the Commonwealth would be seriously depleted if the
African countries left.  They made up the bulk of the membership.
  He said that the question of how badly the Commonwealth would unravel
would be answered soon.
  Australia and Canada had provided international leadership on the issue
of sanctions, Mr Hayden said.
  The Cabinet had explored a "comprehensive range" of possible measures.
  But it had been left to the Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, to decide what
sanctions should be applied.
  His decision would take into account the views of other Commonwealth
countries at a meeting in August.
  Mr Hayden said that Australia did not want to knock itself out of the debate
on South Africa by applying a wide range of sanctions and then finding
that it had nothing left to contribute.
  At the same time Australia had to lead the debate towards a "fairly extensive
set of sanctions."
  Though he stressed that it was a personal view, Mr Hayden said he was
not convinced that the visit to South Africa by the British Foreign Secretary,
Sir Geoffrey Howe, would be fruitful.
  "I think that they are going to find it very difficult," he said.          
  So the issue comes back into everyone's lap, and in particular Britain's."

 <h> Boycott by 19 nations feared </h>

<misc> LONDON, Sun: </misc>

  Organisers fear that as many as 19 of the 49 nations entered
in the Edinburgh Commonwealth Games could join the African-led boycott.
  Five countries have already said they will keep their athletes away from
the Games - due to start on July 24 - mainly in protest at the British
Government's refusal to impose trade sanctions on South Africa.
  Tanzania confirmed today that it would join the movement started by Nigeria
on Wednesday which was then followed by Ghana the same day, by Uganda
on Friday and by Kenya yesterday.
  The countries which have pulled out are also upset at the inclusion in
the English squad of two South African born women, runner Zola Budd and
swimmer Annette Cowley, both of whom use British passports. 
  Organisers believe the growing momentum of the boycott could cause it
to sweep through the other 10 African countries in the Commonwealth:
Botswana, Gambia, Lesotho, Malawi, Mauritius, Seychelles, Sierra Leone,
Swaziland, Zambia and Zimbabwe.
  Zimbabwe is waiting till next week's meeting of southern African nations
in the "front line" of the struggle against South Africa's apartheid system.

 <h>$53m. prison `a waste' </h>

<h> CASUARINA SITE A MISTAKE, SAYS LIB. </h>

OPPOSITION front-bencher George Cash has derided the State Government's
decision to build a new $53 million maximum-security prison at Casuarina.
  The decision would waste taxpayer's money and create a security risk,
he said.
  He called a press conference yesterday after spending the morning at
the Canning Vale Prison complex - a site that he favours for the new prison.
  Mr Cash, the Opposition spokesman on prisons, asserted that the
Government's decision to build the gaol about 5km east of Medina and 4km
from Parmelia was "shrouded in secrecy and deception."
  He said that questions raised by the Opposition in State Parliament had
gone unanswered by the Minister for Prisons, Mr Berinson.
  Questions asked by anxious nearby residents had also gone unanswered.
  Mr Cash said he believed that there was no sound basis for building the
gaol at Casuarina when Canning Vale was designed for a maximum-security
unit.
  He said that when the Canning Vale complex was developed by the Tonkin
Labor Government it was intended that a maximum-security prison would 
eventually be built on the land available on the site.
  It was always intended that the Canning Vale site would replace the Fremantle
Prison.
  Instead, the Government had chosen to build the gaol about 15km south.
  "The fact that facilities will be duplicated indicates that taxpayers
will be paying more than is necessary," Mr Cash said.
  Mr Berinson said last night that there would be no duplication of facilities.
  He said that in retrospect the shared facilities at Canning Vale showed
unfortunate planning.
  "I cannot imagine that Mr Cash should suggest shared facilities at a
maximum-security prison," he said.
  "It would be a security nightmare."
  Mr Cash said that spending on a new prison site was absurd when "only
two weeks ago the Premier told us to tighten our belts."
  "And the fact that prisoners will have to be escorted that distance between
the two gaols represents an unnecessary security risk," Mr Cash said.
  There would be only a marginal saving in building the gaol at Canning
Vale instead of Casuarina, he said.
  However, the service facilities at Canning Vale - equipment and maintenance
- would need to be duplicated at a new gaol.
  Mr Cash said that the Environmental Protection Authority's 1981 System
Six study report recommended that the site at Casuarina be vested in the
WA Wildlife Authority because of its significant flora, fauna and water.       
  The Government appeared to be rejecting this recommendation for no apparent
reason.
  Mr Berinson said that it was a System Six area but the prison would occupy
only 30 hectares out of the 180 hectares.

 <h> I'll fight Govt, vows resident </h>

AN ENVIRONMENTAL report on the Casuarina reserve destined to become a prison
should be released, says a man who lives 50 metres from the reserve.
  Mr Jim Elliot has called on the State Government to release a report
prepared by the Environmental  Protection Authority for the former Minister
for Environment, Mr Ron Davies, last August.
  "Local residents have a right to know all the details," Mr Elliot said.
  The decision to build the prison on the conservation reserve went ahead
though the EPA advised against it.  The site was studied by the EPA under
its System-Six report.
  EPA chairman Barry Carbon said that the former Minister was advised last
year that it would be inappropriate to develop the Casuarina site.
  But the Government says it will go ahead with the project.
  It will set aside $100,000 to buy other land as compensation, and has
designated that the department of Conservation and Land Management manage
the buffer zone around the 30-hectare prison.
  The plans have made Mr Elliot (33) of Orton Road, "hopping mad" and he
says he will fight to stop the Government "desecrating" the site.
  He has written a five-page letter to the Kwinana Town Council asking for
a public referendum on the issue and he is also organising a petition.
  Mr Elliot wants the Minister for Prisons, Mr Berinson, to outline why
Casuarina was chosen as the site.
  Mr Ian Fraser, president of the Kwinana Rural Ratepayers and the Residents'
Association, said the disbelief he felt when the prison was announced had
since turned to anger.

 <h> Warning of threat to wage fixing </h>

<misc> MELBOURNE: </misc>

 The current system of wage fixing was under threat, the
director-general of the Confederation of Australian Industry's industrial
council, Mr Bryan Noakes, warned yesterday.
  He predicted that the system would end if there was continued industrial
action of the type since the national wage decision.
  But Mr Noake's warning came as an end of the petrol dispute appeared
to be in sight.
  He said that the Australian economy was being torn to shreds by
irresponsible union actions.
  "The actions of the Storemen and Packers Union in particular over the past
week has cost the economy millions of dollars in lost production and has
imposed massive inconvenience on the ever suffering Australian public,"
he said.
  "This followed hard on the heels of similar action by the waterside workers
that also cost the economy dearly."
  Mr Noakes said that many unions seemed unable to appreciate the reality
of the economic crisis - and intent on finding ways to exacerbate the
problems.  
  He said that the industrial council decided at a meeting in Sydney
on Friday that employers had simply had enough of these actions.
  If they continued, the CIA would seek to have the national wage bench
reconvened to consider the future of the present wage-fixing system, he
said.
  Employers were not going to bear the cost of increases awarded through
the commission and also bear the cost of claims being pursued with industrial
action in the field.
  But petrol stations will begin receiving fuel today if striking oil workers
accept an industry peace package at mass meetings this morning.    
  The end to the nine-day dispute neared after 30 union delegates yesterday
agreed to recommend a return to work.
  The meeting of Federated Storeman and Packers' Union delegates accepted
the Arbitration Commission's recommendations for a return to work and a
re-negotiation of oil-industry wage rates.

<h> Waiting for a big family </h>

A FINE old home in Vale Road, Mt Lawley, deserves a family, according to
the present owner who has been its main occupant for several years.
  It could certainly accommodate a big family, as it was built on a grand
scale, like many other old Mt Lawley homes. 
  The house is divided into two self-contained sections, with the main area
in front, and a granny flat behind.  The latter could be used either for
this purpose or as children's quarters, or the house could be restored to
its original one-residence form.
  The 1923 Federation-style home was built for Mr Stephen Earle and bought
from his daughter by the present owner in 1972.
  It was built by Cavanagh and Spanney, who were involved with the construction
of St Mary's Cathedral, as well as with a number of other grand old Mt Lawley
residences.
  Its outstanding features include jarrah timberwork throughout, original
stained glass and leadlight windows and light fittings in 
turn-of-the-century style.
  The ceiling cornices in the main rooms feature patterns of WA wildflowers
- geraldton wax, wattle, gumnuts and leaves - with a different flower in
various rooms.
  There are four fireplaces, with oak and jarrah surrounds.
  The house will be auctioned on site at noon on June 7.
  The main section consists of an entry hall, formal sitting room, dining
room, three*threee double bedrooms, kitchen and study, all surrounded by verandas.
  A striking feature of the dining room is a draped layer of cream chinese
silk sewn into the ceiling.
  The refurbished kitchen, which includes a breakfast nook, is equipped with
a gas stove and electric oven and opens on to a sunroom, with enclosed veranda
beyond to provide an extensive outdoor eating area when fine weather beckons.
  The bathroom has also been upgraded, and boasts a carpeted floor - the
old bath is now filled with water lilies in the backyard.
  The granny flat, which has not been used for two years, is designed on
versatile lines and could well serve as children's quarters.
  It has a separate entrance and looks out on a huge terraced garden and
barbecue area which is a delight - it would be hard to imagine a better
place in which to "get away from it all" when the going gets tough.
  There's also an orchard section, producing lemons, grapes, mandarins,
and a special plus, a fruiting avocado.
  The gardens, which are reticulated from a bore, are spotlighted, to
provide a touch of magic on a summer night.
  Rose bushes abound in the front garden, where there are also terraced lawns.
 Barry North or Gerald Morgan, of Acton Consolidated, will open the house
for inspection from 11am till noon on Wednesdays and Saturdays, and also
by appointment at other times.

 <h> Rushing down the road to Mandalay </h>

Tourists are allowed only seven days in Burma. T.R. LANSNER tells how he made
the most of his one-week visit to this mysterious and colourful land.

DAWN on the Irrawaddy:  Pink patches colour grey-shaded clouds obscuring
the eastern horizon.  The dark line of the riverbank below takes on a more
solid substance and the black expanse of night sky softens towards blue.
  A riverside pagoda stands in elegant silhouette against the paling sky
as our steamer manoeuvres close in to shore.  A few large-wheeled bullock
carts are drawn up by a tiny jetty at this obscure stop on the daily run
downriver from Mandalay to Pagan in upper Burma.
  Few foreigners take these leisurely cruises down the wide, mighty and
muddy Irrawaddy.  Burma allows tourists a maximum seven days' stay - fly
in, fly out, and no extensions considered.  Most visitors try to cover as
much territory as possible in that time, packing a month's worth of pagodas, 
markets, hill resorts, arts, crafts and cultural shows into a hectic week which
eventually leaves them nearly comatose with exhaustion in the Rangoon Airport
departure lounge.
  A trip down the Irrawaddy means missing some other beautiful or fascinating
place, but with the short glimpse of the country permitted by Burmese
authorities, such choices must be made.
  The journey begins at Rangoon Airport, where you are immediately introduced
to official Burma, and very shortly thereafter, to unofficial Burma.  A
thick sheaf of customs forms must be completed in detailed duplicate.
  Cameras, watches, cash and jewellery are listed on several forms duly
inspected and stamped by unhurried bureaucrats.  The process can take an
hour or more, and you feel heartily sick of officialdom when you step from
the customs hall straight into the waiting grasp of the black marketeers.
  "What do you sell?" is their greeting, "I buy your whisky, what price?"
  Burma boasts a strict socialist economy which has driven the resource-rich
country to the brink of ruin.  The great fuss over filling in customs forms
is necessary because few consumer goods are legally imported, though the
demand is great.  Into the gap step entrepreneurs who will buy virtually
anything foreign, from whisky to cigarettes to walkman*walkmen radios, perfumes
and pornography, for resale in the local markets.
  Nearly every tourist arriving in Burma carries a bottle of Johnny Walker
Red Label whisky and a carton of cigarettes to sell on arrival for a fistful
of kyat, the Burmese currency.  Some shoestring travellers scruff by on
as little as $US 40 for the week, and for a bit more you can live quite
well.
  Just south of Mandalay, I found a festival under way.  Merchants,
restaurateurs, and fortune-tellers had set up shop, and by their raucous
behaviour many young men seem dedicated more to imbibing good spirits
than honouring them.  A circus and a freak show offered diversion under
an immense canvas tent, and a rudimentary carnival drew a fair crowd.
  Its prime attraction was a primitive ferris wheel.  It was "powered" by
a gang of about 15 nimble young men who clambered with monkey-like agility
to the top of the wheel while it was held fast below.  When those on the
ground released it with a great shove, the weight of the climbers propelled
the ferris wheel through its initial revolution.  With finely-timed leaps
to the ground, they deserted their precarious perches as the wheel and its
riders continued to spin above them.
  Much of what is often described as Burma's "charm" is its peoples' ability
to make do with limited modern material resources.  From a man-powered ferris
wheel to the 1950s vintage cars which potter about Rangoon's boulevards,
it is a country which seems to be caught in a time warp, left at a less
complicated and less frenetic level of existence.
  For the tourist able to take in only seven days of wonders, the relative
difference in pace is even more striking.  Places where you could easily
spend days are seen in hours, and many spots must simply be left unseen.
  But unless the recurrent 20-year-old rumours that the Burmese will "soon"
allow longer visits miraculously come true, tourists will have to be satisfied,
if not satiated, with their one week excursion to a land which merits much
longer exploration.

 <h> It could only happen in the Kimberleys </h>

The first of a three-part series by Tom JENKINS, who has just returned from
a visit to WA's remote north.
  THERE's a python at the bottom of Aileen Hackett's garden.
  It's probably about 4.5 metres long and about once a week (at night) it
comes to feed on the birds in the Pandanus Palm Wildlife Park and Zebra
Rock Gallery which Mrs Hackett runs beside the Ord River near Kununurra.
  While she is getting irritated about the python, or helping a kangaroo
joey back into his bag hanging on a veranda post (or caring for pigeons,
parrots, emus and donkeys, or polishing zebra rock into gemstones) her husband
Noel is busy growing bananas.
  It could all only happen in one part of Western Australia: The Kimberleys.  
The Hacketts have been on the Ord for 22 years.  Like many other people there,  
they have tried different ways of making a living: Cotton, wheat and chaff, 
then, five years ago, they got a new block of land on Packsaddle Plain and are 
now getting good prices for bananas sent to Perth and Adelaide.
  Their wildlife park is becoming known and in the busy season they may
have 300 visitors a day.  At the bottom of the garden (in truth, at the
end of the paddock beyond the garden) is the Ord River, broadened here into
Lake Kununurra behind the Diversion Dam.
  They have a mining lease to take the beautiful red-and-cream zebra rock
from an island in Lake Argyle, the huge and controversial lake nine times
the size of Sydney Harbour created behind the main Ord River Dam.
  We met the Hacketts on our second day in the Kimberleys.  On the evening
of the first day, we had driven to Lake Argyle.
  The road lay through noble red hills, their rocky spines ridged like
dinosaurs, the views into purple distance framed by slender, pale trees,
jade-green-leaved.  As the sun sank, the red light intensified so that the
hills glowed.
  Past the rather tatty Lake Argyle tourist village (a recycled construction
camp - there are plans for grander things) we drove up a stony hill and gazed
somewhat stunned, across this man-made lake.  It stretches forever, blue,
deep, serene.  Maybe its potential as a source of irrigation will never be
realised, but it is a sight that lifts your heart, this great water in a
dry land.
  There was just time to see the replacement for Argyle Downs Homestead,
now drowned.  It is too ordinary a building, but the mementos of the Durack
family are moving.
  By the time we left, the sun had set.  Under dying light, the old rocks
turned to purple.  Birdsong seemed to stop.
  We looked down into an ancient pool that, for millions of years has been
fed by waterfalls, shrunk by searing heat.  For a moment, I think we understood
a little of what this land means to the Aborigines.

 <h> Hospitals `allow patients to die' </h>

<misc> MELBOURNE: </misc>

  Some doctors in Melbourne hospitals are allowing terminally
ill patients to die by withdrawing treatment from them in certain
circumstances, says one medical director.
  The practice was going on even though it was illegal, said Dr Syd Allen,
medical director of the Queen Victoria Hospital.
  Dr Allen said changes to the law were necessary to protect medical staff
before the situation was tested in court.
 Doctors feared a court case could result in "an assault" on the medical
system, he said. 
  Dr Allen said he was confident that the courts would support such a practice
in certain circumstances, but acknowledged that doctors could be charged
with manslaughter if life-preserving treatment was withdrawn from a terminally
ill patient.                                     
  Dr Allen was speaking after addressing a public hearing organised by a
government committee inquiring into "options for dying with dignity".

 Ninety per cent of Australians think their State police forces are doing
a good or a fair job, according to the Gallup Poll.
  Only eight per cent said their police were doing a poor job: two per cent
were undecided.
  Tasmanians, South Australians and Victorians were all very pleased with
their police forces.
  The poll found a "good" rating in those States of 65, 63, and 62 per cent
respectively.
  In WA, 57 per cent gave a "good" response, 36 said fair and four per cent
poor.
  WA had the highest (three) percentage of undecideds.
  Satisfaction was lowest in NSW, where only 39 per cent felt their police
were doing a good job.
  Forty-eight per cent regarded police work as fair, and 11 per cent
described it as poor.

<h> Murder, murder, and more murder </h>

PAUL STEVEN HAIGH, Victoria's worst mass murderer, confessed in
court last week to two more killings - bringing his gruesome tally to half
a dozen slayings.
  In 1979, at the age of 21, Paul Steven Haigh had already chosen his path
in life.
  It was to be bloody, filled with treachery and desperation, deadly jealousy
and a string of murders which shocked the country.
  Last week, in Melbourne's Supreme Court, the final curtain at last came
down on a savage and horrendous drama that had lasted nearly eight years.
  In an 11-month killing spree that began in September, 1978, seven people
were slain - six of them by the hand of Haigh, Victoria's worst mass murderer.
  Haigh, now 28, was taken back to Pentridge Prison last week after pleading
guilty to two more murders.
  He had been in Pentridge since 1981, after being convicted of the murder
of four people - one of them his girlfiend, another a nine-year-old boy.
  While in gaol, Haigh confessed to two more killings, becoming only the
sixth man in Victorian legal history to plead guilty in court to murder.
  Haigh confessed to police that he had shot a woman during an attempted
armed robbery at a Tattslotto agency in Windsor in September, 1978.
  He also confessed to killing a man during an attempted armed robbery at
a South Caulfield pizza shop in December that year.
  High said he killed Miss Evelyn Abrahams (58) in the Tattslotto agency
because he feared she was trying to run away.
  Miss Abrahams had turned her back on him and opened an office door to
ask an office manager: "What should I do?"
  Haigh told police he didn't hear the woman speak.  He thought she was
trying to be heroic.
  Haigh said he then shot her in the back of the head with a shotgun.
   In the second killing, Haigh confessed that he had jumped over the counter
of the South Caulfield pizza shop and had demanded money.
  When the owner of the shop, 45-year-old Bruno Cingolani, dived for a knife,
Haigh shot him in the stomach.  Mr Cingolani, a father of two, died three
days later.
  Last week Haigh was sentenced to a life term for each murder, the sentences
to be concurrent with the four life terms he received for the other murders.
  PAUL Steven Haigh was a good friend of convicted killer Robert Wright.
  Wright became friends with another criminal, convicted double killer Barry
Quinn, when Quinn was on the run after escaping from Pentridge Prison.
  Quinn was a ruthless and cold executioner.  Together, Haigh, Quinn and
Wright made a terrifying trio.
  This fearsome association culminated in five ruthless killings.
Quinn had escaped from Pentridge Prison on November 15, 1978, with the aid
of Eve Karlson and others.  His escape led to the multiple murders.
 The first to die was Quinn's girlfriend, Ivanka Katherine (Eve) Karlson,
who was shot at Mississippi Creek, near Warburton, between November 16,
1978 and July 30, 1979.
  On the run, Quinn and Karlson had met two other people, Sheryle Anne Gardner
(31) and her friend, Robert Wright.  Together they headed for Quinn's hideout
in the Warburton area.
  Both Eve Karlson and Sheryle Gardner had, at one time, been lovers of
Quinn.  There was a tension, a spiteful jealousy, brooding darkly between
the two women.
  After 69 days on the run, Quinn was recaptured.
  Some time later, Eve Karlson's decomposed body was found on the banks
of the Mississippi Creek.
  Although Quinn had confessed to killing Karlson, the police did not believe
him.  They felt he was covering up for Sheryle Gardner.
  The following month Sheryle Gardner was slain, along with her child.
  The connection between the next four killings was Quinn's escape from
Pentridge.
  On June 27, 1979, Wayne Keith Smith (27) was shot dead as he lay on his
bed in his St Kilda Road flat.
  Quinn had used Wayne Smith's house "for a couple of days" straight after
his escape, while Smith and Eve Karlson went about setting up a hideout
in the Warburton area.
  Then, on July 22, 1979, Sheryle Gardner and her son Danny William Mitchell
(9) were shot dead as they sat in their car at Ripponlea.
  On or about August 8, 1979, Lisa Maude Brearley (19) was stabbed 157 times
in Olinda State Forest, after being lured there on the pretence of a party.
  Her body was discovered on August 23 after an accomplice, fearing for
his life, contacted the police.
  Brearley had been Haigh's girlfriend.
  Police were to discover later that Wright and Haigh had used her to buy
the rifles used to kill Sheryle Gardner and her young son.
  Haigh, Wright and Quinn were all charged.
  Police said they had committed the murders because they thought the victims
"knew too much" about Quinn's escape from prison and the subsequent events.
  Quinn and Wright were acquitted on the charge of having murdered Eve
Karlson at Mississippi Creek.  Haigh was not implicated in this killing.
  Haigh was found guilty of murdering Gardner, Mitchell and Smith but not
guilty of murdering Brearley.
  Both Haigh and Wright were sentenced to life imprisonment.
  Back in prison, Quinn met a horrifying end when he was covered in industrial
glue and set alight in a workroom in Pentridge's maximum-security Jika
Jika section.  He was rushed to hospital but died soon afterwards.

<h> Pensioner loses in ticket row </h>

<bl> By George Williams </bl>

  A single parent pensioner with a severely handicapped child has been billed
$47.50 for parking in a Subiaco street space that she helped to plan when
she worked for the council.
  Mrs Val Bokhari, of Applecross, said that she was guilty of the offence,
but the council seemed unnecessarily hard to ignore her letter which asked
for leniency.
  She had been running late for a dental appointment in Kings Road, Subiaco,
when she parked on the incorrect side of the street.
  She realised that she had broken regulations when she received a pink
slip in the mail days later demanding that she pay a $20 fine.
  She said "I am a pensioner but I am determined to pay my way.
  I realised that I must have broken the parking rules and I was to pay as
soon as I could along with all the other bills."
  She delivered a cheque to the council about a month after the fine was
due.
  "Next thing a letter turned up returning my cheque and including a summons
for court," she said.
  "I returned the cheque to the council with a letter explaining my
circumstances - that I have debts of over $20,000 and I am on the pension.
 I said that I was guilty but I asked for a little leeway, that's all.
  "Then the court bill arrived - demanding $47.50."
  Mrs Bokhari said her letter was never answered by the council.
  She said: " I suppose it's almost funny that I worked for the council
for three years and one of my jobs was marking out the different parking
zones."
  She said that she had served the council well, working for less than the
usual rate of pay and that she had worked at short notice on rush jobs.
  The council had even telephoned her to ask her to work on the eve of her
wedding eight years ago.
  The Subiaco City Council town clerk, Mr Jim McGeough, declined to comment
on Mrs Bokhari's case.

 <h> INQUEST TOLD UNSAFE LOAD CRUSHED DRIVER </h>

  A truck driver neglected safe loading and unloading procedures and his
load crushed him to death.
  Two experts said this today at an inquest into the death of Michael St
John Kennedy, of Floreat.
  A Factory and Shops inspector, Mr Graeme Hearn, said that failure of the
firm, James Hardie and Co, to ensure safe loading had also contributed to
the accident on March 13.
  A Department of Occupational Health inspector, Mr Francis Keough, said
he thought Mr Kennedy's 10-year familiarity with handling cement pipes for
the company may have been a contributing factor.
  Unloading ramps had not been pulled out according to James Hardie procedure.  
  Mr Hearn said Mr Kennedy was a contract driver responsible for his own
loading.

 <h> Lecturer flies in to pick up his degree </h>

James Lim Bian Tee flew 3500km to be in Perth today to receive his degree.
  The 56-year-old university lecturer travelled from Penang, in northern 
Malaysia, to the ceremony at the WA College of Advanced Education.
  He had been studying through the college since 1983, but had never set
eyes on the institution before.
  Mr Lim is the first overseas external student in 12 years to collect his
degree in person.
  His wife Anne, who teaches English in Penang, accompanied him.
  The round trip, with accommodation, will cost the couple about $1400, Mr
Lim estimates.
  "It's worth it," said Mrs Lim.
  "It is an honour to study here and I felt that personal contact was
important," Mr Lim said.
  He took a bachelor's degree in education at the WA CAE because it offered
a speciality in religion.

 <h> Conflict in the air at Leningrad's perfumery </h>

<bl> By Norm Sanders </bl>

  SENATOR Norm Sanders continues his reports on his tour of the Soviet Union
and Poland with an Australian parliamentary delegation.
LENINGRAD. - We were exhausted by the time we got back to the hotel at 8.30pm.
  Our day had started that morning with the Gromyko meeting in Moscow. 
It seemed like a week ago.
  We reassembled in the hotel dining room for dinner.  
  The restaurant was modern and well patronised, in contrast to the Moscow
hotel's grandiose emptiness.  A small band played ideologically sound rock
while we organised ourselves at our table.
  A stream of male waiters brought in the food.  We were never served by
females in the Soviet Union, which is a pity because the waiters universally
suffered from underarm odour.
  Knowing how much to eat of course at a formal dinner is hard enough at
home.  In a new country, it's almost impossible.
  At first in the Soviet Union I made the mistake of loading up on the
extremely substantial preliminaries: smoked sturgeon, cold cuts of meat,
tomatoes, and sometimes two soups. (There were also loads of cucumbers,
which are my pet aversion).
  Then, feeling quite sated already, I had to face perspiring waiters carrying
prodigious main courses of steak, veal, or chicken and potatoes.
  Any crannies left after this lot were subsequently filled with ice cream.
  Our only beverages were the ubiquitous mineral water, tea and coffee.
 Never a trace of alcohol touched our lips.
  I got up at 6 o'clock the next morning, determined to walk off all the
excesses of the previous evening.
  I noticed, gratefully, that the car and bus drivers were very polite to
pedestrians.
  At one stage I was crossing a side street when a bus turned off the main
thoroughfare and headed right at me.
  In Australia I would have had to dash for my life.
  In Leningrad, the driver stopped, smiled and motioned me in front of him.
  Little courtesies such as this impress tourists - a lesson some Tasmanian
drivers have yet to learn.
  Like Moscow, the main streets in Leningrad are wide and tree-lined.
  Every few hundred metres there are bulletin boards where Pravda and the
other newspapers are plastered for those who don't wish to spend the few
kopeks to buy their own.
  It was here that I encountered my first graffiti:  Someone had scrawled
"Don't work!" in Russian in large letters across the front page of Pravda.
  This must be the supreme sacrilege in a society which glorifies the value
of labour.  A little further on, a peace symbol had been chalked on a wall.
  I later asked Big Igor Saprykin about the graffiti's significance.
  "Hooligans!" he snorted, "It is of no importance."  He seemed annoyed.
 Whether at the graffiti or at me noticing it, I couldn't tell.
  I showered and joined the others for our 8am breakfast.
  Our entire itinerary was laid out with military precision, down to 24-hour
time notation.
  Our last item on today's schedule was supper at 2245, after a dozen
engagements.
  Breakfast, like all the other meals, was a massive production:  Cold meats,
fish, cheese and yoghurt, followed by cool toast in the English tradition.
 Then came fried eggs or blintzes (pancake filled with cottage cheese)
which were delicious.
  These bountiful meals didn't come cheaply.  The Soviets footed the bill
for the delegation, but spouses were charged $70 per day for food.  We paid
these charges, along with spouses's air fares, out of our own pockets.
  By 9am we were at the Piskarevskoye Memorial Cemetery for a wreath-laying
ceremony.
  During the siege, bodies had to be buried in mass graves.  A total of
640,000 men, women and children lay here in an area of some five hectares.
  The cemetery is comprised of a series of low grassy mounds the size of
a tennis court.  Each mound holds 30,000 bodies.
  I wrote, "We must never have another war," in the visitors' book.
  On the way back to the cars, I reflected on the 20,000,000 Soviet war
dead with Ambassador Ted Pocock.  He grumbled, "Stalin killed 20,000,000
and the Russians don't build monuments to them."
  I suppose he had a point, but I was weary with death and didn't want to
get into an argument at that moment over whether Hitler or Stalin was the
most brutal tyrant.
  We were next shunted to the Aurora Borealis perfumery where we were met
by a smiling Mr Y.A. Aleksandrovich, a tall, fair-haired man with glasses,
who told us about his factory.
  The perfumery started in 1860 under the name of the "St Petersburg Chemical
Laboratory."
  Today, the perfumery has over a thousand workers and supplies perfumes
and colognes for the Soviet Union and the export market.
  While we talked, a stylish blonde woman who was responsible for new products
handed out strips of cardboard with different scents for us to try.
  Mr Aleksandrovich talked of his factory's constant search for new
fragrances.  I mentioned Tasmania's essential oils industry which I vaguely
remembered from a story I did once as a TDT reporter.
  He showed considerable interest and I subsequently arranged for the
Tasmanian essential oils people to contact him.
  Our embassy staff prodded me into asking a question about shift work.
  The Soviets normally work during the daytime on weekdays.  However, Gorbachev
had recently decreed that shift work should be implemented to use idle
production capacity, and that Leningrad would be the first to use the new
system.
  I naively asked Mr Aleksandrovich what he thought of the idea.  His
pleasantries vanished.  It was obviously a touchy subject.
  He explained that his plant was labour intensive and that there was little
idle machine capacity at night.  At this point our Soviet minders started
arguing with him.
  The ensuing discussion was geographical as well as ideological.  Our minders
were all from Moscow, the Big Apple of the USSR.
  Anybody from Leningrad was distinctively provincial.  For their part,
Leningrad residents consider themselves intellectually and artistically
superior to the clods from Moscow.
  John Denton and Rakesh Ahudja from our embassy were overjoyed with the
shift work information which became another piece for their jigsaw puzzle
of Soviet society.
  Mr Aleksandrovich and the blonde enthusiastically waved goodbye from their
factory door, relieved that we had gone.
  We weren't quite sure why we had visited the perfumery in the first place
but had little time to ponder this question as we hurtled off to the Hermitage
to see acres and acres of Rembrandts.

 <h> Home building gets tonic </h>

<h>$7.5m scheme will provide 150 houses in State initiative </h>

<bl> By Michael Gleeson </bl>

A HOUSING construction initiative to cost $7,500,000 was yesterday launched
by the State Government to boost the State's ailing industry.
  The Minister for Housing, Mr John Beswick, said that in the next 12 months,
150 houses would be built under a new scheme sponsored by the Tasmanian
Development Authority.
  The homes will be offered to low-income first-home buyers, who will be
eligible for low-interest loans from the TDA, provided they are ineligible
for both bank and building society loans.
  Funds for the project come from State loan funds, some funds from the
Commonwealth/State Housing Agreement and revolving funds, including the
repayment of loans from people who have had previous loans with the TDA.
  Registered builders approved by the Tasmanian Development Authority will
receive interest-free TDA loans to buy suitable land.
  A ceiling price will apply to single blocks of land, with the loan secured
by a first-mortgage contract in favour of the TDA.
  Houses will be built to plans approved by an architect nominated by the
TDA, and will be financed progressively during construction.
  Finally, qualifying low-income earners will be advanced low-interest loans
and introduced to builders through real estate agents.
  Buyers are entitled to a maximum TDA loan of $55,000,with interest initially
at 10 per cent, rising to 12 per cent in the third year, after which an
interest review would take place.
  There will also be a price limit of $60,000, including the cost of the
land.
  According to Mr Beswick, the scheme will employ 66 men for one year, with
the multiplier effect employing an additional 162.
  Each successful tendering builder will be expected to construct 15 homes.
  According to Mr Beswick, homes not bought within two months of completion
will be purchased by the Housing Department or the TDA.
  Mr Beswick said it was not an initiative provided for in tomorrow's Budget.
  It was "an internal allocation of funds by the TDA, funds which are generally
available for this purpose".
  "The authority, in consultation with myself as Minister for Housing,
has seen fit to earmark $7,500,000 for this scheme as a means of stimulating
the homebuilding industry," Mr Beswick said.
  The scheme, known as HOBIS or the Home Ownership Building Industry Scheme,
joins the Housing Department's home-purchase scheme as the State's two
major housing initiatives.
  "That one (the Housing Department scheme) is designed to help people
buy houses, rather than to build new houses like this one," Mr Beswick said.
  He said there would be no scaling-down of the Housing Department's programme
in the Budget to make way for this scheme.
  The TDA has identified some 200 for HOBIS homes.

 <h> RACT is critical of single lane plan </h>

THE RACT has criticised a plan to build the new Bass highway between Launceston
and Deloraine substantially to singlelane standard.
  The RACT's Launceston manager, Mr Lloyd Redman, said that as the link
between Launceston and the North-West was the busiest stretch of national
highway in Tasmania it should be all dual-lane highway.
  "This is a major route for tourists and heavy vehicles taking sea freight
to Devonport and Burnie," he said.
  "A single-lane highway will not be adequate for present needs, let alone
the future.
  "Why has the DMR (Department of Main Roads) chosen to end the dual-lane
at Hadspen?"  (It will be dual-lane as far as Hadspen, and single-lane from
Hadspen to Deloraine).
  "At the very least there should be overtaking lanes and all bridges built
to dual-lane specifications," Mr Redman said.
  While he welcomed the new highway, he said that the good sight-distances
and straights of the highway would encourage constant overtaking, with the
accompanying risk of high-speed head-on accidents.
  The Westbury Council also welcomed the new highway yesterday and accepted
the DMR's estimation that singlelane standard would be adequate.
  The road - which will take five to seven years to build - will connect
with the Prospect bypass which runs from Launceston's southern outlet to
the western outskirts of the city.
  The new highway will cross the existing Bass highway at Prospect and
run just north of it until the Pateena Rd junction (which leads to Longford).
  The new road crosses back to the southern side of the existing one just
past Pateena Rd, and remains on the southern side until just east of Westbury,
where it crosses back to the northern side.
  Two routes are being considered for the Westbury-Deloraine section: 
one which remains on the northern side of the present road and one which
crosses back over the existing road to bypass Exton to the south.

 <h> Federal Cabinet Cruises Through A Stormy Session </h>

<misc> SYDNEY. - </misc>

Jackhammers drowned out any controversial press questions on
mining Kakadu National Park, and the Minister for the Arts, Mr Barry Cohen,
looked like a tourist with his video camera as the Prime Minister, Mr Bob
Hawke, and Federal Cabinet prepared to put to sea yesterday.
  This is the Royal Australian Navy's 75th anniversary year and the 16
ministers boarded HMAS Stalwart at Garden Island yesterday morning to mark
the historic occasion with an equally historic first - Federal Cabinet's
first meeting at sea.
  After the meeting, with the Cabinet still on board, HMAS Stalwart sailed
from Garden Island to rendezvous with the destroyers HMAS Sydney and HMAS
Perth for exercises.
  As his ministers enjoyed a cuppa on the flight deck, Mr Hawke inspected
the guard and the Navy band - members of which were beginning to look
decidedly chilled.

 <h> Govt told to act on bankruptcies </h>

<bl> By Leonie Biddle </bl>

  A high level of bankruptcies is costing Northern Territory suppliers
hundreds of thousands of dollars a year.
  NT Trading Association president, Ms Lea Rosenwax, said problems with
failed businesses had reached epidemic proportions.
  The main difficulty stemmed from bankrupt company directors starting
new businesses despite outstanding debts from their previous failed
enterprises, Ms Rosenwax said.
  As a result, each Territory supplier was writing off more than $50 000
a year on bad debts.
  "The situation has reached epidemic proportions because no one is taking
action against these people," Ms Rosenwax said.
  "You find businesses going down the gurgle one week and almost immediately
the same people bob up under a new name without any repercussions."
  She said the revamped NT Companies Act prescribed substantial penalties
for undischarged bankrupts.
  But these were not being enforced.
  The problem was exacerbated by the NT Government continuing to award
contracts to builders who were undischarged bankrupts.
  "It is up to the Government to enforce its own regulations but it doesn't
want to know," she said.
  Ms Rosenwax said the trading association, representing 50 Territory building
suppliers, had approached Transport and Works Minister, Mr Nick Dondas.
  But his office had responded it was up to the market place to prosecute
defaulting customers.
  "We believe it is up to the Government to ensure contracts are not awarded
to people who are breaking the law," she said.
  The association also had approached Corporate Affairs Office in Darwin.
  It wanted the office to enforce the Act and refuse to register companies
whose directors were undischarged bankrupts.
  "It seems the Corporate Affairs does not have the resources to check
the backgrounds of company directors."
  Ms Rosenwax said the association would not let the matter rest.
  The community had paid dearly for the lack of action against unscrupulous
business practices.
  One survey showed 540 unincorporated businesses in South Australia and
the NT were declared bankrupt in 12 months to June 1985.
  These failed businesses, including registered firms, had cost SA and
NT creditors almost $11 million.
  Ms Rosenwax  said the association had decided to get tough on unscrupulous
business people.
  It also was pushing for the urgent establishment of a register of companies
with proven expertise and financial backing to carry through contracts.
  It had been pressing for this move for a number of years to reduce the
incidence of companies defaulting on a project while it was in midstream.

<h> Moves to stop Australia card </h>

<misc> MELBOURNE. - </misc>

 The Victorian Council for Civil Liberties has launched a campaign
to stop the introduction of the Australia card.
  It is calling on State Premiers and the Northern Territory Chief Minister,
Mr Steve Hatton, to refuse to co-operate with the card legislation.
  The legislation depends on the assistance of the State and Territory
births*birth, deaths and marriages registers and lands titles offices to 
operate.
  The council's president, Mr Ron Castan QC, said the Australia Card Bill
confirmed the council's worst fears about the effects on Australian society.
  "The implications of this legislation make it much more intrusive on our
privacy than any systems existing in any European or north American country,"
he said.
  There would be a de facto compulsory obligation to carry the card.
  This was despite the suggestion the legislation implied the holding
of the ID card would be voluntary.
  "There will be growing unofficial use of the card to the point where
it will be difficult for most Australians to determine whether or not they
are legally obliged to produce their card," Mr Castan said.
  The Victorian council also was concerned at the way in which the Federal
Government had fudged issues*isues in the debate on the card.
  The Federal Health Minister, Dr Neal Blewett, had said the card would
deal with welfare fraud.
  But that assertion ignored evidence given to a parliamentary committee
by the Social Security Department, Mr Castan*Costan said.
  The department had said identity was a cause of fraud in less than 1 per
cent of cases and the net result of ID card checks would be zero dollars.
  "The Government has ignored the enormous cost involved in having people
take time off work to have their photograph taken and gain their birth
certificates," Mr Castan*Costan said.
  "It ignores the work time lost as each Australian is required to line
up to be interviewed by a public servant before being assigned a number.
  "There also will be costs imposed on ordinary decent Australians when
Australia card computer errors inevitably occur."

<h> Howard's wife stands by him </h>

<misc> CANBERRA. - </misc>

 As the supposed hordes of Peacock supporters close in on the
Opposition Leader, Mr John Howard, and the hounds of the media smell a
Liberal leadership challenge, you can count on one thing.
  Janette Howard will be in there, standing right beside her man.
  There is no other phrase for it:  Mrs Howard is an oldfashioned,
straightdown-the-line wife to her life mate.
  And although she sat through the same philosophy lectures*lecturers as 1960s
notable rebel student, Mr Richard Neville, there is no feeling of her ever 
having been a student radical.
  When you look at the record of Janette Parker, to give Mrs Howard her
maiden name, the feeling gets stronger.
  She was also a Master of Arts student in Australian literature and she
was always a staunch Liberal, with a big "L".
  As Miss Parker, she "had the experience of being the only person (in that
philosophy class) who put my hand up to say that I believed in God".
  "The lecturer talked about `Miss Parker's God' all year," Mrs Howard recalls.
  "I might add that I have met that lecturer in later years and he has
apologised."
  Sitting in her husband's office in Canberra, Mrs Howard is now talking
real uppermiddle-class politics as she sips coffee from a heavy china cup
stamped with the Australian Coat of Arms.
  "John says I am getting more conservative as I get older.
  "He and I have some of our biggest arguments over conservative social
issues.
  "For instance, I would hang people and John would never hang people,"
she says.
  "We have argued for hours over that.  I think we both know the arguments
backwards.
  "Oh yes, yes of course.  But that's our version of marriage.
  "I mean most of the political wives do.  They wouldn't be there if they
weren't interested.
  "I mean the very first thing that attracted me about John was something
I heard across the room and I thought, `I have got to go over and talk to
that fellow'.
  "We first met at a political meeting."
  But as a university-educated, politically-aware person, there must be
some regrets she is sitting in her husband's office while he is out on the
floor of the chamber running a censure motion on the Hawke Government's
handling of the economy.
  "No, because ... when I first met John, one of the things that I understood
about him was that he was a far better politician than I would ever make."
  Why?
  "Because he has an evener keel than I do.  I mean I fly up about things
then I think about them and change.  John has a far evener quality.  He
has qualities that I couldn't match."
  One pet subject she "can talk about for hours" is education.
  Mrs Howard, with an Arts degree from NSW University, has taught at various
high schools.
  She has also taught at the co-educational school of Killarney Heights
in Sydney's northern suburbs.
  The experience changed her mind about the value of co-educational schools.
  "I just feel that girls and boys who are at the age say 12 to 15 are at
very, very different stages of development."
  Did she ever dream she would one day be sitting in the Opposition Leader's
office?
  "Well, for one thing back then, I would have thought that was the Labor
Party, because when I was at the university, the Liberal Party was still
in Government and I was sufficiently pig-headed enough to think they would
never leave."

 <h> Action over new phone tap powers </h>

<bl> By Bill Goff </bl>

  <misc> CANBERRA. - </misc>

 A new national body is likely to be established next year
to control telephone tapping on behalf of State Police and the National
Crime Authority as well as Federal Police.
  The move would amount to an extension of official phone-tapping powers
to fight major crime, but would prevent the control of taps passing to State
police forces or the NCA.
  The establishment of a single national authority to control taps - which
would still need judicial warrant to begin - is a compromise solution to
a long debate about the civil liberties dangers of extended tapping powers.
  It is believed to have emerged from a parliamentary joint committee
on telecommunications interceptions which is due to report to Parliament
later this week.
  Government sources said yesterday that although the national agency idea
was not an ideal solution, it would probably prove an acceptable way out
of a difficult problem.
  The Federal Opposition, the National Crime Authority and some others
including former Painters and Dockers Royal Commissioner, Mr Frank Costigan,
have all argued for the full extension of phone-tapping powers to State
police and the NCA.
  On the other side civil liberties groups, the Australian Democrats and
the Federal Labor Caucus have voiced strong concern about the threat to
rights.
  In June this year Caucus succeeded in having legislation which would have
extended some tapping powers to State forces and the NCA sent to a joint
select committee.
  It is that committee which is due to report this week, and all factions
of the ALP are expected to be in the majority which will want the new agency.
  This is an indication that changes to the legislation stand a good chance
of winning Caucus approval.

 <h> Custodian gets land title </h>

  Federal Aboriginal Affairs Minister, Mr Clyde Holding, arrived in Darwin
unannounced yesterday and handed over title for the most contentious land
parcel in Kakadu National Park.
  Traditional Bunitj custodian, Mr Bill Neidjie, a patient in Royal Darwin
Hospital, accepted the Aboriginal land title to the Jabiluka National Land
Trust.
  Mr Holding said his sudden decision was based on compassionate grounds
after "Big Bill" was admitted to hospital on Friday with pneumonia.
  "This is a serious condition for a person his age and circumstances,"
Mr Holding said.
  "And I felt obliged to ensure the early delivery of the title for which
he and his people had waited so long."
  Aboriginal title for the mineral-rich area of about 400 km2 or 7 per cent
of Kakadu National Park stage 2, was first recommended under the South
Alligator River stage 2 land claim on July 3, 1981.
  Mr Holding said in making his decision he had taken into account recent
submissions from the NT Government and mining giant Peko EZ.
  The area, including the multi-million dollar Ranger 68 deposit, was the
subject of legal action since the minister indicated his intention to grant
the remaining land in 1983.
  The NT Government sought an injunction last month to prevent the minister
recommending the grant to the Governor-General, Sir Ninian Stephen.
  Mr Holding revoked his decision and gave the NT Government and Peko EZ
further opportunity to make submissions.
  Surprised
  "I received these submissions and considered them closely along with
other relevant material," Mr Holding said.
  Mr Holding claimed the granting of title was not related to the Federal
Government's decision to ban mining in Kakadu National Park stages 1 and
2.
  Mr Holding's visit surprised the Northern Land Council, the NT Government,
and the Darwin-based National Media Liaison Unit which did not know his
intentions until after 6pm yesterday.

  The Territory Government has changed its policy on the Uluru board of
management.
  The Chief Minister, Mr Steve Hatton, told the Legislative Assembly today
he was nominating the Tourism Minister, Mr Ray Hanrahan and Conservation
Minister, Mr Terry McCarthy, to the Government's vacant position.
  Under the previous Tuxworth administration the Territory boycotted
representation in protest at the handover of Uluru National Park to Aborigines
last year.

<h> Watchdog bound in fraud hunt </h>

<bl> By Matthew Stevens </bl>

  CHAIRMAN Henry Bosch says the National Companies and Securities Commission
has neither the staff nor the money to chase the corporate fraudsters.
  He says it has never successfully trapped an insider trader, that illegal
share warehousing occurs often without punishment and that the growth of
"sharp business practice" is damaging the already battered reputation of
the business community.
  In recent weeks, world headlines about the insider trading of Wall Street's
fabulously scandalous Ivan Boesky has focused attention on the level of
insider trading in our own markets.  According to Bosch, insider trading
happens frequently but is almost impossible to prove.
  To emphasise his point, he produced a computer print-out showing a dramatic
improvement in a small company's share price.  He said the real price growth
happened two weeks before an "absolutely vital press announcement on a
new contract".
  He said:  "But to go from that information to finding out who did the
business and then prove that he knew about the contract before the information
was made public is very difficult and very, very costly.  We could not afford
to chase all the insiders."
  But that, he says, is not the biggest problem.  Bosch sees collusion
as the greatest threat to the sort of equality of opportunity for shareholders
which he believes is why regulation should exist in the first place.
  "There have been frequent cases of collusion in which nominally independent
bodies have acted in a way that is mutually supportive.  If the agreements
had been written down, those actions would have certainly been in breach
of Section 11 of the Companies Act.  But, as we all know, these agreements
are never written down and it is very difficult to prove what we know to
be true."
  He added:  "I will not make specific comment, but you may draw some inference
on the present inquiries."  It was an obvious reference to the NCSC's inquiry
involving what is now an international investigation into the purchase of
a $58 million parcel of takeover-targeted Humes Ltd.
  The NCSC has an annual budget of $5.7 million.  It has eight commissioners,
three full-time and five part-time, and 82 permanent staff of whom about
30 have resigned this year alone.
  Like other Public Service bodies which  attempt to deal with the highest
level of the business community, the NCSC has tremendous trouble recruiting
the best staff because of its "highly inappropriate" Public Service salaries
and conditions.

 <h> Soothing statistics don't solve 1987 economic prospects </h>

<bl> By Anne Flahvin </bl>

DESPITE last month's lower trade deficit and the OECD's forecast of strong
GDP growth in 1987, doubts are emerging in the market place about the prospects
for next year's economy.
  Soothing words from the Australian Bureau of Statistics confirming the
accuracy of the November current account deficit of $685 million have been
taken to heart by a financial market searching desperately for any good
news.  Combined with the OECD's forecast of a surprisingly strong 3.25
per cent GDP growth rate, this continued to support the Australian dollar
on Friday.
  But the feeling among some economists and foreign exchange dealers this
weekend is that the November deficit figure will still be revised upwards.
Estimates of the strength of any possible upward revision vary considerably,
but Melbourne economist Patrick O'Leary, of McCaughan Dyson and Co, says,
"There is no way the figures can be right.  Not even when Afghanistan was
invaded did its imports fall by a fifth."         
  Expectations for the January and February balance of trade figures are
also not optimistic, with the market already forecasting a resumption of
$1 billion plus monthly deficits next year.
  The Government is believed to be hoping to contain the current account
deficit to $6 billion in the first six months of calendar 1987.  While market
watchers say this is possible, some remain sceptical.
  This weekend, market experts are tipping real growth of between 1.5 and
2.5 per cent over the coming year.  This is well short of the OECD 3.25
per cent, which also conflicts with the outcome which is hoped for and expected
by Federal Treasury.
  Traditionally, OECD forecasts on the Australian economy have mirrored
fairly closely the views of Treasury as the Government of the day has been
able to persuade the OECD to endorse the Treasury line.
  But the Government's ambition to rein in the current account deficit would
probably receive a body blow if the Paris-based organisation's forecast
of 3.25 per cent growth was realised.
  On the outlook for growth in 1987, Patrick O'Leary is not optimistic,
"The contribution to GDP from investment went negative in the full year
to September," he said.
  "The Keating assumption is that growth will come from net trade, but if
the $A continues to go up we are not going to get a positive contribution
to GDP from net trade.  So where is the growth going to come from?
  "It is not going to come from private sector activity - the average
household is in hock up to its eyebrows," he said.
  Many market watchers question whether the Reserve Bank will be able to
retain the control it has exercised during the past few months over the
$US/$A exchange rate.
  The Reserve Bank has been an active player in the market in an attempt
to reduce the volatility of the exchange rate, and Ray Block, economist
with brokers Dominguez Barry Samuel Montagu, says that provided pressure
from our booming sharemarket eases a little in the new year, the Bank will
be able to reassert its control.
  "The perseverance of the bank is very important to us - the degree of
volatility in our currency should not be perceived to be greater than other
currencies," he said.
  According to Kevin Tuckey, corporate adviser with Macquarie Bank "the
Reserve Bank is not trying to put a lid on the $A, it is just trying to
slow its growth" in a climate of strong overseas support for our currency.

 <h> Coal trade relies on kamikaze </h>

<bl> By Brian Robins </bl>

JAPAN'S coal traders like to refer to it as the "kamikaze" that will protect
the Australian coal industry from the worst of the shake-out from falling
demand in Japan:  "kamikaze" - divine wind - being the impact of sanctions
on South African coal exports.
  Few countries have refused to buy South African coal, although Japan's
powerful Ministry of International Trade and Industry recently told Japanese
users of South African coal that next year's purchases had to be held at
this year's level.
  MITI's decision follows the recent success of the Democrats in the US mid-term
elections.  The Japanese Government believes that with the Democrats in control
of the US Senate there will be an increase in sanctions against South Africa.
To avoid criticism of Japan, MITI decided to act.
  Japan's demand for coal will fall substantially in the medium term.  This
change is being exacerbated in the short term by sharp price falls - about
$US4 a tonne for coking coal and as much as $US5 a tonne for steaming coal
in the Japanese market.
  For some high-cost Australian producers closures are inevitable. 
  In private, senior members of Japan's steel mills have made it clear they
do not intend abiding by MITI pressure to continue to maintain purchases
of US coal.
  The outlook for some marginal Australian producers is bleak.
  Most Australian coal producers are among the lowest-cost producers in
the world, but even then few can compete against South African coal in export
markets because of its lower cost structure and lower exchange rate for
the South African against the US dollar.
  In any event, the severe recession being felt by Japan's steel producers
is being used to maximum effect in forcing some long-term suppliers out
of the Japanese market no matter what contractual commitments are in place.

 <h> Ageing of Europe limits our growth </h>

<bl> By Andy Stoeckel </bl>

  WALK AROUND the shopping centres and parks on a Sunday in Hamburg or Kiel
in West Germany and there's something striking - no kids!
  The unprecedented demographic revolution taking place in Europe will
have widespread economic effects and global repercussions for Australia
as well as for other countries.  This revolution is probably already affecting
economic policy in key countries and limiting the chances for world recovery.
  One West German demographer estimates that if the current decline in
population continues there will only be half as many Europeans in the year
2086 as now.  The lowest birth rate is in West Germany - 1.3 children per
woman - the lowest in the country's history.  Already the lower population
growth rates mean housing and land prices are falling at a time of supposedly
good economic growth and that has bankers worried.
  Some of the effects, such as closing schools and teacher layoffs (look
out for a big immigration of European teachers) are obvious enough.  But
the main economic influence will come from the ageing of the population.
This ageing is a consequence of declining birth rates and increasing life
expectancy due to medical advances.
  Over the next 25 years many of the major industrial economies - the "engines"
of the world economy - will have huge increases in the number of pensioners.
In Europe by the turn of the century 25 per cent of the population will
be over 60 years of age.  Moreover, the number of workers - the people paying
for the pensioners - will fall.
  The proportion of pensioners to the labour force will rise dramatically
to 64 per cent in West Germany and more than double in Japan to 43 per cent
by 2030.  These effects for key countries are shown in the chart.  This
increased burden of old people - higher medical care costs, pensions and
entitlements - will mean some hard choices for governments. They have four
choices: allow an explosion of public sector debt, increase taxes (including
by inflation), cut pensions and entitlements, or cut other expenditure.
  It is this prospect of ballooning public sector debt that is affecting
the slow world recovery, the falling US dollar and hence our own prospects.
  First, as stated in previous articles in this column, macroeconomic policies
between the majors are out of phase. While the United States has been running
large fiscal deficits, West Germany and Japan have maintained tight fiscal
policies. This has contributed to the huge US current account deficit,
the enormous debt build-up and the falling US dollar.
  One of the often-stated remedies is for the Japanese and West Germany
economies to reflate their economies through fiscal expansion. A domestic
expansion by these two should lead to increased imports, encourage world
economic growth and ease the US trade deficit.
  While true, this point should not be overplayed. Martin Feldstein, past
chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, a US economic
think tank, estimates that a 2 per cent a year rise in GNP in every country
in the world for the next two years would raise US exports in 1989 by less
than $US15 billion - only 10 per cent of the the US trade deficit! That
is also the reason there has to be a further big decline of the US dollar.
  Income changes alone will not close the US trade gap and price changes
(devaluations) will be necessary.
  But there is no doubt that fiscal expansion by West Germany and Japan
would lift world economic growth, ease US trade problems, improve world
trade, lift commodity prices and ease Third World debt problems. So, why
don't West Germany and Japan expand more than they are doing now? Wouldn't
that be universally popular? Let us go back to the ageing factor.
  West Germany and Japan face public sector debt explosions to finance the
increasing pension costs (see chart). Organisations for Economic Co-operation
and Development projections of public sector debt in these countries, assuming
no change in pension costs and taking account of the likely changes, highlight
the dramatic influence of the demographic changes. The ratio of debt to
GNP in Japan could be over 100 per cent by 2010.

<h> Politicians set to toil harder for their pay </h>

<bl> By Michael Grealy </bl>

THE underworked politicians who fill the red leather benches of the NSW
Legislative Council may soon have to toil harder for their handsome salaries.
  State Cabinet has received a report recommending a Senate-style committee
system for the 45-member NSW Upper House.
 The council, for most of its 130 years a chamber of privilege and life-long
appointments, has survived repeated calls for its abolition and even a
referendum on its future as late as 1960.
  The Wran Government introduced the greatest reform of the council in 1978
by making it elected by popular franchise.
  The reform continued last year, when council members gained salary parity
with Legislative Assembly MPs and could devote their energies full time
to Parliamentary duties.
  `Geriatrics'
  Now, a select committee has proposed a system of five standing committees
for the council, a reform described last week by the committee's chairman,
Mr Ron Dyer, as one of the most significant developments in the council's
history.
  Mr Dyer, a Labor member of the council since 1979, admitted that council
members could make a greater contribution for their $43,098 salary.
 "In the past, the council was called a house of geriatrics and a gentlemen's
club," he said.
  "While there might have been some truth in this criticism, now that all
the members are full time and being paid on parity with Lower House members,
they ought to be working full time, but it is probably true to say they
are not sufficiently occupied at the moment.
  "The House needs to find a role, and the most effective way is by the 
committee system."
  A former Liberal member of the council, Mr Lloyd Lange, called for a
committee system in 1980 but it was not until last year that the idea was
embraced by the ALP.
  The Premier, Mr Unsworth, then Government leader in the council, set up
the select committee, a fact Mr Dyer believes will help its passage through
Cabinet.
  The Dyer committee has recommended the immediate introduction of four
standing committees, covering subordinate legislation and deregulation,
State progress, social issues and country affairs, and a fifth committee 18 
months later to scrutinise legislation to ensure that civil liberties are not
infringed. 
  The report says the Australian Senate's committee system is comprehensive,
respected and acknowledged as having been responsible for revitalising
that chamber.
  It says the committees would give the Legislative Council greater relevance
and effectiveness, enhanced respect and greater sense of involvement by
members with contemporary issues and government business.
  "They won't obstruct government operations but complement them and give
the public input to policy before it finishes up in legislation," Mr Dyer
said.
  The select committee also recommended an expansion of the Public Accounts
Committee, the Legislative Assembly watchdog, to include Upper House members.
  The new joint committee should be required by law to examine at least one
statutory body in detail every six months, it said.  The choice should be
random to act as an incentive to good management of statutory bodies.
  Mr Dyer said the extra costs of the committees would be a "very modest
$1 million".

<h> The face of terror 1986 </h>

<bl> By  Frank Walker </bl>

<h> THE hit women - more deadly than any man </h>

The face of terror 1986 is female.  Women have taken over Europe's terrorist
groups and they are deadlier than the male.
  The cold-bloodedness of a spate of murders, bombings and maimings carried
out by women over the past few months has shocked Europeans.
  West German police chiefs have responded by instructing recruits: "Shoot
the women first".
  Three weeks ago in Paris, Georges Besse, head of the Renault car firm,
was walking home and was just 50 metres from his front door.
  Two women jumped out from the shadows.  One held a sub-machine gun to
cover the street and the other shot 58-year-old Besse three times - in
the chest, shoulder and head.
  French police launched a nationwide hunt for two of France's most wanted
terrorists - Nathalie Menigon, 29, and Joelle Aubron, 27.  Both are leaders
and chief executioners in France's extreme left terror group, Action Directe.
  The shooting had remarkable similarities with a terrorist execution in
the West German capital Bonn a few weeks earlier.
  Gerold von Braunmuehl, a top official in the Foreign Ministry, was leaving
a taxi outside his home when three masked people slid out of a car over
the road.
  One covered the street with a machine gun, while the others calmly walked
over to von Braunmuehl.  One guarded the other's back while the killer
pumped bullet after bullet into von Braunmuehl. 
  Police believe the killer was either Barbara Meyer, 38, or Inge Viett,
42, a former kindergarten nurse and one of Germany's most wanted terrorists.
  Women have been part of the terrorist scene in Europe from the early days
of the notorious Baader-Meinhof gang of the 1970s.
  Ulrike Meinhof was a campaigning journalist until she took to more direct
action and, with Andreas Baader, embarked on a bombing and shooting spree
across Europe that left more than 100 police in hospital and one judge dead.
  Meinhof hanged herself in jail.  Baader and his girlfriend, parson's daughter
Gudrun Ensslin, committed suicide in jail after an attempt to free them
by hijacking a Lufthansa plane ended in failure at Mogadishu, the capital
of Somalia.
  After their deaths in 1977 Europe breathed a sigh of relief.  The experts
claimed the problem had been "solved".
  But a new generation, mostly women, now runs the terrorist cells, known
in West Germany as the Red Army Faction, in France as Action Directe and
in Italy as the Red Brigades.
  "These people are stronger and the new ones seem to be only interested
in killing," said Alexander Prechtel, of the Federal Prosecutor's Office
in Bonn.
  There is a hard-core of around 20 killer commandos, more ruthless and better
organised than the Baader-Meinhof gang.
  Of the 18 most wanted terrorists in West Germany, 11 are women.
  But what drives them to commit their acts of terror?
  Dr Henri Giraud, psychiatrist to the Paris courts, said: "The traditional
role of women is being turned upside down and female terrorists - like all
beginners - are unusually zealous.  The want to expropriate male power.
Paranoia produces an inhuman calmness ... Menigon and Aubron killed Georges
Besse the way they would break a vase."
  Terrorists shared common characteristics, he said:
  They all came from upper middle-class homes.
  They all had good educations and had embarked on a career when they turned
to terrorism.
  Nearly all the women seemed to have met a man already involved in the
terrorist "radical chic" scene before they got into it themselves.
  Many had unsatisfying childhoods - long, silent frustration surrounded
by affluence.
  ANGELIKA SPEITEL, a green-eyed, 34-year-old blonde, is the first female
terrorist to speak about life in the Red Army Faction.
  "Everybody wanted to be very cool," she said.  "In reality we were all
very scared but we would never have admitted that to each other.
  "There was always a bit of homesickness, a need for love.
  "There was never any love among the members. You can't have actions in
your head and love someone at the same time.  You have to have a hate, otherwise
it wouldn't work."
  Speitel was captured in 1978 in a shoot-out with police.  One officer was
killed.  Whether she or another terrorist fired the fatal shot is still unclear.
She was wounded in the leg.
  She was sentenced to life imprisonment.  In a recent interview inside
her Cologne jail with a German magazine she gave a rare glimpse of the
psychology of the terrorist.                               
  She admits it is hard to speak about her "family", her fellow terrorists.
In 1981 she went on a hunger strike in Cologne jail to join terrorists
kept in another jail.
  "I was afraid of dying.  I was dying a little more each day.  But I thought
if I didn't join the hunger strike then*than I will be forever alone in this
cell."
  For two years Speitel was in solitary confinement.  She was considered
too dangerous to mix with the other prisoners.  She tried to kill herself.
It was the prison chaplain who finally got her to talk.
  For months she kept throwing him out of her cell. Then she started shouting
at him, launching a tirade against society, the prison, the Church, anything
that came to mind.  The chaplain just sat and listened.  
  After a while the revolutionary dogma sounded very thin.  She realised
she knew nothing about fascism or imperialism apart from the slogans she
shouted.  She started talking about herself.
  She was angry about the class system which she felt kept her family down
- her mother worked in a shop, her father was a skilled worker.  When she
was 20 she moved into a commune in Stuttgart.
  She married Volker Speitel, an unhappy man who dabbled in radical politics.
When they split up, she moved in with a group of men involved in organising
terrorist acts.
  In 1976 she was introduced to Peter Boock, one of the RAF commandos. "He
struck me as the man I had been waiting for.  His innocent brown eyes -
I thought I have to be careful with him.
  "When I met Boock I had this incredibly good feeling - I felt I had at
last decided to join the fight for freedom.  I felt I had freed myself."
  She went underground with Boock but the affair lasted only three weeks.
Then she fell into the routine of the group.
  "Emotions had to be suppressed. They kept on asking me why I was laughing
or crying.  They said I had to have a reason.  I suppressed laughing and
crying from then on.  
  "They were constantly talking about my readiness to join the actions. 
In the first few years I was always ashamed that I wasn't ready to join
in.  I would tell them I wanted to, that I wanted to get the prisoners out
of the jails.  I just didn't want to think how we would actually go about
it.  I was inhibited. 
  "Only those who were actually going to do the action were allowed to hold
the floor.  The others would say I didn't really want to join in.  I did,
but when it came to getting up that morning I just couldn't.  When they
came for me I was still lying in bed. 
  "I started to cut myself off from the others.  I felt so alone.  But I
wasn't allowed to talk to anyone else.  When they found I had talked to
the cook in a hotel or gone to a disco by myself all hell broke loose. 
They questioned me for hours."
  Her job was to arrange the hideouts.  She took part in the planning of
the murders of the bank chief Jurgen Ponto, and employers' leader Hans Martin
Schleyer.  After the suicide in jail of the terrorists Baader, Meinhof and
Ensslin many of the group wanted to quit.  They realised they wouldn't change
the world with their actions.                       
  "But we couldn't leave.  The others were all watching us.  We didn't even
dare talk about doubt, wounds, aches and feelings.  It was a living 
death.
  "It was a time of immaturity for a lot of us.  We didn't know what life
and death was. It was a frenzy, an addiction which went too far."
  Speitel now lives with a group of female prisoners and is learning to
be a seamstress.

 <h> Dollar's crash has claimed another victim </h>

<bl> By Susan Hely </bl>

BUYING a cheap, good used car is becoming a thing of the past.  Over the
past 12 months cars have done an incredible shrinking act.
  Twelve months ago, $5,000 would have bought a four-year-old car such as
a Laser or Colt or perhaps a six-year-old Mazda 626.  Since then the price
has jumped at least $1,000 and still rising.
  Used car salespeople say this is partly the result of owners keeping their
vehicles, rather than buying a new one, because of the huge rises in new car
prices, triggered by the recent drop in the Australian dollar.
  The outlook for new motor vehicles is poor.  Total sales this year are
tipped to fall 24 per cent, from last year's record 695,000 to 525,000.
  Car owners who are selling are acutely aware they can get quite a bit
more than they could have, say, 12 months ago.  They will need it if they are
thinking of replacing the old car with a new one.
  Some used cars are selling for more than the owners originally paid for
them.  This is the case for the Honda City.  The 1984 models, with 30,000
kilometres on the odometer, are selling in a range of $8,000 to $8,900, according
to last week's Sun-Herald classifieds. They cost $7,500 new.     
  The owners of these cars are aware that the replacement price has risen
sharply and a new Honda City is selling for a little more than $10,000 (plus
the on-road costs).
  The argument for buying a new car now is that they will hold their resale
value and will keep rising given the outlook for the Australian dollar.
  The car salespeople claim there is something to be said for scratching
funds together to buy a new car.
  And it is tempting to consider the possibility - until you do the sums.
  If a 1980 automatic Mazda 323 costs $6,000 at present, what is the cheapest
possible new car going to cost?  Well, one which is comparable is a Mitsubishi
Colt, but on the road a new one will cost around $11,000.
  So perhaps there's nothing for it but to scour the motor market pages or
maybe consider the possibility of leasing a car occasionally.
  This is a particularly good idea for someone who lives close to public
transport or in the inner city.
  For example, it can be cheaper (but not as convenient, of course) to lease
a car from time to time and make do with a mix of public transport and taxis
for the rest of the time.
  The NRMA claims a modest late-model car costs around $100 a week to run
- excluding petrol.  A luxury imported car is twice that.
  By comparison, renting a modest car for one day a week will cost $39.
  The NRMA's survey shows that it costs $5,153 a year, excluding petrol,
to run a family car like a 1986 Toyota Corona automatic sedan if you drive
15,000 kilometres a year.  That's about $99 a week.
  But if you decided to rent the same Corona every second week between 4
pm Friday and 10 am Monday, you could do it for $2,492 a year or $48 a week.
 In both cases petrol is extra.

AUSTRALIAN share markets finished the week on a firm note, unmoved by the
record one-day falls on the Tokyo and New York share markets and negative
news of Moody's credit re-rating.
  The All Ordinaries index closed only marginally weaker - down 2.6 points
at 1235.9 after a bout of profit-taking in gold and industrial shares.
  Analysts pointed to overseas buying of blue chip miners, which appear
attractive in light of a low Australian dollar, and firm gold stocks as
the main impetus for the markets resilience.
  Of note was the strength of Woolworths' share price following a 90 per
cent fall in profit for the first half.  Takeover speculation halted a share
price slide as the New Zealand group, Chase Corporation, is believed to
have added a further 2 per cent to its 3 per cent holding on Thursday when
it bought a line of 4.38 million Woolworths shares.
  Ron Brierley's Industrial Equity Ltd appeared to acquire some 724,480
Adelaide Advertiser shares on Friday, a trade representing 1.4 per cent
of the company.  This acquisition is particularly interesting given IEL's
recent purchase of a 5 per cent holding in Herald and Weekly Times.

<h> Central role in nation's finances </h>

ESTABLISHED in January 1960, the Reserve Bank is Central Station to the
nation's financial traffic.
  It has a staff of more than 3,600 in all States and Territories as well
as key representatives in London and New York.
  It is banker to governments, banks and certain other financial institutions;
it prints and manages the nation's bank notes; and it provides some short-term
seasonal finance for the rural sector.
  Its major purpose is to formulate and implement monetary policy, which
has been described as the fine-tuning knob on the TV set.  Fiscal policy,
determined by government, is the bigger one that changes channels.
  As agent for the Federal Government, the Reserve Bank distributes coin,
conducts stock registries for Commonwealth securities and manages the
Commonwealth's domestic borrowing programs.
  From its headquarters in Sydney's Martin Place, it also oversees Australia's
foreign exchange market and holds and manages Australia's official reserves
of gold and foreign exchange.
  At the end of the 1985-86 financial year, the bank's total assets of $16.9
billion included almost $2 billion of gold, $8.6 billion of foreign exchange
and $4.7 billion of treasury notes and other securities.
  The governor and chairman of the board, Mr R.A. Johnston, and deputy
governor, Mr D.N. Sanders, hold seven-year appointments.  The secretary to
the Treasury, Mr Bernie Fraser, ranks third.
  Five of the other board members, TNT's Sir Peter Abeles, Sir Samuel Burston,
Mr J.N. Davenport, Mr R.G. Gregory and Sir Gordon Jackson, are all prominent
business leaders.  The former ACTU Vice-President Mr Charlie Fitzgibbon
represents the union movement.

 <h> Trust aims to profit from imputation </h>

<bl> Peter Freeman </bl>

THE planned introduction of dividend imputation is still 10 months off,
but at least one unit trust manager, Bankers Trust Australia Ltd, is
positioning itself to take advantage of the potential tax benefits.
  Under dividend imputation a company will pay tax at the proposed new rate
of 49 cents in the dollar, but this will then be allowed as a credit against
the tax liability of dividends paid to shareholders.
  An investor with a top rate of 30 cents in the dollar will be able to
claim 19 cents in the dollar as a credit against other income.
 The trust - launched at the start of July and known as the BT Equity Imputation
Fund - has raised $2 million and has been actively seeking shares that offer
the best chance of generating the highest imputation benefits.
  By getting in early it hopes to establish a well-balanced portfolio prior
to the expected rush into high-yielding shares later in 1986-87.
  Investors who buy units in the BT Equity Imputation Fund will be indirect
shareholders in the fund's shares and benefit from imputation, which takes
affect from July.
  Shares that presently yield 7 or 8 per cent pre-tax effectively will
give investors an after-tax return of 12 to 13 per cent as a result of
imputation.  
  But remember, it is not necessary for a local share fund to set up
specifically to take advantage of imputation since all of them will benefit
from this change.
  All that the BT fund is doing is signalling to investors that it will
be aiming specifically at taking the maximum advantage of imputation.
  As well there is always a possibility the Federal Government will change
its mind, although imputation was unaffected by the recent Federal Budget.
  Bankers Trust has attempted to lift the attractiveness of its new imputation
product by linking it with three specialist international trusts under the
banner of the BT Select Markets Trust.

 <h> US air fares cut by 25pc </h>

CONTINENTAL Airlines slashed its Sydney - New York economy fare by 25 per
cent yesterday as a price war flared again.
  For business and first-class passengers, the saving is two tickets for
the price of one.
 Continental's new economy return fare to the Big Apple is now $1,399 -
undercutting its rivals by $505.
  Mr Col Hughes, general manager of Continental, said the new price had
been introduced to mark the start of the airline's one-stop direct flight
from Australia to New York on October 26.
  He said passengers who bought return first or business class tickets on
the flight would receive a second ticket free.  The new economy fare will
not be available during the peak Christmas period.

 <h> Penfolds opens its high-tech bunker  </h>

<bl> Huon Hooke </bl>

When Penfolds concluded a successful takeover of Allied Vintners in 1985
its managers were horrified at the plans for the new Seaview champagne cellars
at Reynella, south of Adelaide.
  Allied, which encompassed Wynns, Seaview, Tulloch and Killawarra, was
spending millions on what Penfolds thought was a highly impractical*highly-impractical and 
inefficient champagne complex, made up of three partly underground bunkers
with six enormous concrete slabs as floors.  
  Penfolds' first move was to scrap the Seaview plans, and secondly to draw
up plans of its own for a new Seaview cellar alongside the Penfolds-Kaiser
Stuhl stronghold at Nuriootpa in the Barossa Valley.
   But the contract for the concrete slabs couldn't be cancelled. Penfolds scratched its corporate head and came up with the solution. It used them as walls for one gigantic Seaview building, which was declared open by the SA Premier John Bannon last weekend. The building covers 1.5ha (3.5 acres) and you could fit three football fields in it.
  The standing joke at "pennies" is that when the holocaust comes the employees reckon the bunker will be the safest place to hide. An alternative joke could be that it's almost big enough to hold all the staff of Penfolds, which is the biggest Australian wine company by far.
  Managing director Ian Mackley siad Penfolds crushed 87,600 tonnes of grapes last vintage. He reminded his audience that that memorable vessel, the Queen Mary, weighed a mere 82,000 tonnes.
  Not the least impressive statistic is the amount of loot that's been spent on this fantastic fizz factory: a cool $15 million.
  There's little doubt that Penfolds has the biggest winemaking complex in the southern hemisphere. In France's Champagne district towns of Reims and Epernay there are bigger sparkling wine operation, but I don't believe there is one that could match the impressive array of state-of-the art equipment.
  Perhaps the most startling are the automatic remuage machines, which shake the yeast sediment down to the necks of the bottles after the bottle-ageing. These do, in 10 days, the job that men used to need two months to do. Designed, built and patented in Australia they are bigger than any I have seen in France. They are computer-controlled so they operate continuously. Each machine can take 4,000 bottles and shake them down in 10 days - and there are eight of them!
  Seaview sells about 170,000 dozen bottles of champagne a year, putting it well behind Penfolds' big one, Minchinbury, running at about 550,000. But Seaview is by far the biggest-selling sparkler made by the full methode champenoise - the traditional French champagne method.
  This is a more costly and slow process than transfer disgorgement, the method used by Minchinbury, Seppelts Great Western Imperial Reserve, Orlando Carrington and others. But even Seaview's 270,000 cases is small bubbles beside biggest real champagne,Moet and Chandon, which sells about 1.5 million cases a year.
  However Penfolds is making plenty of room for expansion. The sparkling wine market is growing at about 20 per cent a year, and the new cellar has the capacity to produce 500,000 dozen a year. The storage capacity of the building is one million cases. The base wines are not made in this cellar, but they are bottled and undergo their secondary fermentation there, then afterwards their 12 months bottle maturation on yeast lees, disgorgement, liqueuring, recorking, labelling and packaging.

<h> My captains courageous </h>

A ROSY aura has been manufactured in recent times about the magic of leadership
in cricket.
  Ever since a committee known as the Board of Control for Cricket in the
first place, about 1912, and the Cricket Board, which name evolved during
the presidency or influential stages of Sir Donald Bradman, mainly inspired,
I suspect, from the feelings of disdain*distain and distrust engendered in the
maestro's mind as a result of two memorable brushes he had with it, about
14 or 15 men in the most part miles removed from active on-field experience
in cricket have enjoyed the right of choosing Australia's captain.
  Under such a system it became, during my time, little more than a lucky
coincidence if the board's darling hit it off happily with the players.
  My first experience of leadership in first class cricket was expertly turned
on by Alan Kippax, one of the really great NSW batsmen of all time.
  No local batsman has threatened to surpass him in style and effectiveness
since his retirement in 1934 and who have moved into the same sphere of
competency.
  His contribution was to mould the young NSW Shield side, destitute of
its stars to a mass exodus in 1927-28 which saw great names like Warren
Bardsley, Charlie Macartney, Charlie Kelleway, Hunter Hendry, Tommy Andrews,
Johnny Taylor and Arthur Mailey disappear forever from the game. 
  It needed a highly popular man to hold the deserted fort - a man of
unsurpassed ability in the field of play where examples in batting, bowling,
fielding and acceptable behaviour had to be expounded to a team of new
recruits.  
  Referring to the team, which he led lovingly, as his Portuguese
Army, Kippax carried his job faithfully and skilfully.
  That he was able to turn out men like Archie Jackson, Don Bradman, Stan
McCabe, Jack Fingleton, Syd Hird, Hughie Chilvers and Bill O'Reilly bears
such respect for him that there's nothing more to be said of a man whose
memory must always be revered in this State.
  My first international captain, Bill Woodfull, made easily the greatest
impact upon me at a time when Australia was universally aware that never
before had an Australian cricket captain been called upon for level-headed
leadership in a time of cricket insanity.
  As my captain in the bodyline season, when cricket went mad, Woodfull won
my undying respect and that of every team-mate who faced the music with
him.
  To give you a sidelight of this man of substance, I stress that he was
the son of a Victorian country padre who had taken a leading part in a highly
controversial sectarian flame-up which had darkened many a national horizon
in eastern Australia where sectarianism had been rampant since the bellicose
Prime Ministership of Billy Hughes throughout the two conscription campaigns.
  As a young well-educated man of Hibernian lineage, I had fairly
well-developed ideas on all the kindred topics of that troubled time.
  But it was with almost total disbelief that I found William Maldon Woodfull
to be a man of the strongest possible character who never ceased to treat
everyone of us with the utmost personal respect.
  So much so indeed that he was even prepared to head each interested one
of us off in the direction of his appropriate church on Sunday mornings
on tour.
  He was as brave, I reckon, as Horatius who held the bridge across the
Tiber.
  Twice he batted right through an Australian innings when lesser men about
him fell like ordinary mortals. 
  In Brisbane in 1928 he watched all his batting supports disappear like
flotsam and jetsam in a fast running stream to remain unconquered for 30
in a total of 66.
  Jack White, England's slow left-handed bowler renowned for accuracy in
length and direction, collected 4-7 in which bag Don Bradman's name, listed
at number five, appeared caught Chapman bowled White one.
  The other immortal occasion happened in Adelaide when Woodfull batted
through the second innings total of 193 for 73 not out.
This after suffering one of the most savage body blows ever when a whack
across the heart laid him low and served as one of the two explosive incidents
which set that fatal Test alight.
  In the wake of the puerile to-ing and fro-ing which went on in the 
ensuing*ensuring war of words which culminated in our Board of Control pulling 
down its colours and retreating in confusion, Woodfull's composure and public 
respect were completely unparallelled before or since.
  I regard it as one of my greatest cricket possessions to have been a close
associate of such an inspiring mate in those hours of trial.  
  By comparison with him, all others, I honestly believe, pale into 
insignificance.
  Don Bradman's name comes constantly to the fore when captaincy of class
is being discussed and probably quite rightly so.
  But there were one or two things hard up against his "duck house" which 
will remain forever as potent arguments to be ranged up in criticism by
intelligent researchers.
  First was the dropping of Clarrie Grimmett at the start of Bradman's
captaincy reign in 1936-37 when, as an Australian selector and 
fledgling*fledging captain, he allowed the best spinner the world has seen, a 
point established beyond doubt a few months previously in South Africa, to 
vanish from the Test scene.
  The other was when four of his teamsmen, Stanley Joseph McCabe, Leslie
O'Brien Xavier Fleetwood-Smith, Leo Patrick O'Brien and William Joseph
O'Reilly, went humiliatingly before a sectarian junta of the Board of Control
meeting secretly in Melbourne to face a maliciously evil charge of
insubordination. 
  Each one of my three mates would gladly have welcomed some friendly gesture
from our young captain as we lined up for that painful afternoon with hate
in our hearts.
  I have seen leadership fortunes ebb and flow right from the time of Warwick
Armstrong, and I got to know men like Joe Darling, Hughie Trumble, Clem
Hill, Monty Noble and Syd Gregory who filled the breach before that mountain
of a man.
  There have been many since who have carried out their jobs sufficiently
and successfully, like Richie Benaud and Ian Chappell, and some whose names
will drop through the bottom of the basket without leaving a trace, but
each has been chosen by a band of men whose right to name a leader has never
yet been questioned.
  A recent ploy of theirs to assist in making decisions about blossoming
capacities has been to send a band of men on a lightning visit to India,
there to cement the spirit of comradeship and hone the skills of leadership.
  Kim Hughes did it last season and, returning amid a media fanfare of
trumpets, collapsed in a heap at the end of the Brisbane Test against New
Zealand.
  To bolster Allan Border's ego he too went off to India after having shown
frightening signs of succumbing to strain on a tour of New Zealand last
summer.
  For moral support a retired captain, Bob Simpson, accompanied him in
a cunning sort of wet-nurse capacity.
  Whether this will prove to have been an inspired move or not remains to
be seen, but I draw your attention to the fact that the selectors have sailed
into that India tour attack with their scalpels wreaking even before our
England invasion has got fairly underway.
  Oh, for another Bill Woodfull to put pride into our top team and at the
same time clear the dressing room of all superfluous impedimenta presently
contained therein.

 <h>... And the post-war giants name their best skippers. </h>

<bl> By Brett Thomas </bl>

NSW Cricket Association president Alan Davidson, who played in 44 Tests
between 1953 and 1963, said there have been only two standout captains in
his time - Lindsay Hassett and Richie Benaud.
  "I think Richie was the best mainly because our careers went side by side
from schoolboy days," he said.
  "I understood him and he understood me.  It was always very easy to play
with him."
  Davidson gives Hassett the credit for moulding him as a player during his
first tour of England in 1953.
  "I will always have a very vivid recollection of Lindsay during that tour,"
he said.  "He had a wonderful understanding of a young player.
  "He was only a little man - but he was very big on understanding."
  Blockbusting batsman Keith Stackpole, with 43 Tests under his belt, has
no doubts when it comes to his choice as the best.
  "Ian Chappell was the best I ever played under, then Bill Lawry and Bobby
Simpson in that order," he said.
  "I rate Ian the best because his style of captaincy suited me.  We would
both rather win a match than have it peter out into a dull draw.
  "Bill was more of a defensive captain but he showed the young fellows the
right attitude although he didn't have quite the same material as Ian.
  "And Simmo was a great inspiration because he was always so terribly
energetic."  
  Channel 9 commentator Bill Lawry also names Richie Benaud as the best ever
- with Ian Chappell second.  He would not name a third.
  "Richie was a tremendous captain," he said.  "He was the first of the
modern captains to really appreciate what was needed in modern cricket.
  "The series in which he captained Australia against the West Indies in
1961 started a tremendous boost for cricket.
  "He has done a fantastic amount for both Australian and world cricket
and I've never seen or played with anyone better.
  "Ian Chappell had a tremendous record as a captain and a player and,
statistically, he was also one of the best.
  "His own natural ability shone through and he always led from the front."
  Cricket commentator Richie Benaud said there were only two standout Australian
captains he's seen - Keith Miller and Ian Chappell.
  "Keith was captain of NSW and although he never captained Australia at
Test level I still consider him the best, with Ian," he said.
  "They are the top two - all the others are of about equal standard.
  "The reason they were so good is because they had imagination apart from
their skill and leadership qualities.
  "They had a very good knowledge of the game and were always willing to
take a gamble."

 <h> Oh for a triumphant burst of Botham! </h>

<bl> Patrick Collins, The Mail on Sunday, London  </bl>

A FEW years ago an English cricket correspondent presented himself at the
immigration desk at Sydney Airport seeking entry to that vigorous land of
opportunity.
  The immigration officer looked him over.  He took in the Harrovian tie,
the tropical suit and the superior smile of one who was born to rule. And
he was not impressed.
  For an hour he bombarded the visitor with questions.  Then, inspiration
exhausted, he said: "Do you have a criminal record?"  The answer was impeccable.
 "My dear old thing.  I didn't know it was still compulsory in this country."
  In one encounter the stereotypes had been served; the hostile Australian,
juggling with the chip on his shoulder, and the urbane Englishman, trumping
hostility with a deadly quip.
  But times, sad to report, are changing.  And in the months ahead the English
may look back with a certain longing to their dear, dead days of domination.
  For Australan sport is experiencing - if they will forgive the word -
a renaissance.  As Ian Chappell, that celebrated philosopher and wordsmith,
put it: "Things are looking up.  We're starting to kick a few bums."
  And there is merit in his claim.  In the first Test at Old Trafford, the
Kangaroos - the Australian Rugby League team - were revealed as perhaps the
finest collection of players ever to run on to a Rugby field.
  Of course, they had certain advantages in that they were larger, faster
and considerably more skilful than our brave lads, but they did not simply
beat Great Britain; they beat them out of sight.
  When you recall the ease with which their Rugby Union team did much the
same sort of thing to all the Home Countries, you may conclude that the
Aussies have made their case with the oval ball.

 <h> A Keating Minder? </h>

  Paul Keating is being urged by supporters to pull his head in - before
the Opposition kicks it in.
  At least two Ministers say Mr Keating, the ALP's toughest parliamentary
brawler, needs a "minder".
  They are urging the Prime Minister Mr Hawke to lend him a senior staffer
with sharp political instincts.
  This, the Ministers say, would save the Treasurer from politically damaging
stumbles.
  One Minister said:  "The problem with Paul is that he surrounds himself
with bright young things from the Tax Office and personal staff who are good
mates with the forex boys (foreign exchange dealers), but none of them has a
scrap of basic political nous."
  Whether Mr Keating would willingly accept advice from one of Mr Hawke's
minders is doubtful.
  In May, he appealed to Mr Hawke to discipline his minders, saying he was
in a "permanent stoush" with them.
  The stumble this week that triggered ALP concern - and gave the Opposition
such joy - was Mr Keating's admission that he was "too busy" to lodge tax
returns.
  Senior Ministers were furious at the Treasurer's failure to meet the most
basic demand of the Tax Office.
  The parliamentary row that followed the admission gave Opposition MPs the
chance to get a bit of their own back on Mr Keating, and they queued up
with glee to deliver their barbs.
  THE Keating gaffe took a lot of gloss off what had, until then, been a
good sitting for the Government.
  And the Opposition isn't finished with the issue yet.
  Senator Tony Messner, Opposition spokesman on taxation, told the Sunday
Press last night that the tax return row would be "a monkey on Mr Keating's
back for the rest of his career".
  "It will weigh down Mr Keating and the Hawke Government," he said.
 "Mr Keating's failure to lodge his own returns undermines people's faith
in this Government, that it actually means what it says.
 "The affair cast a terrible feeling of lack of sincerity."
  The tax return affair caps a bad year for the man once called "the world's
best Treasurer".
  Mr Keating's first major stumble was in May, with his "banana republic"
outburst.  
  He warned that Australia was in danger of becoming a third-rate
economy - and adverse reaction to what was an off-the-cuff radio interview
sent the dollar and the stockmarkets tumbling.
  Mr Keating has had a running battle all year with opponents to his tax
reforms, particularly the powerful lobby against the fringe benefits tax.
  When he claimed a $17,400 travel allowance for time spent away from his
home base in Sydney - while he and his family were living in rented
accommodation in Canberra, his opponents had a field day.
  Mr Keating copped more bucketing when the promised tax cuts were postponed,
and he introduced a tough Budget that imposed a broad new range of indirect
taxes.
  But feelings in his own electorate were the most serious problem of all
for Mr Keating.
  An opinion poll at the end of August showed that the Treasurer, who has
swept the NSW seat of Blaxland seven times since 1969, now had to face the
fact that his seat had become marginal.
  The survey showed that only one half of 1 per cent separated Mr Keating
from his Liberal opponent.
  Labor Party polling over the past two months has shown that the Treasurer's
abrasiveness is a political liability.
  And that was before he tried to "tough out" the row over his late taxation
returns.
  Even his friends and fellow NSW Right-wingers, including the powerful Senator
Graham Richardson, have advised Mr Keating that he had become too distant
from the broad mass of Labor voters.
  The late tax return underlines the point.  Most Australians, Labor or Liberal,
get their returns in on time.
  Mr Keating didn't file his 1985 tax return until it was more than a year
overdue, and he was three months late with his 1986 return.
  Senator Messner, a taxation agent, said: "He set a very poor example to
Australia's 6 1/2 million taxpayers.  I am fearful of the consequences
of a leading figure creating a precedent.
  "I don't know if it would be a defence for latecomers to say they were
too busy, like the Treasurer, but many will try it."
  Asked when he lodged his own return, Senator Messner said:  "I don't have
to hire a tax agent, I am a tax agent.  I put mine in in July.  I understand
the rules.
  "Mr Keating's claim that he is a busy man was rough - everybody's busy.

 <h> It's no cheer on beer </h>

HOTELS across Melbourne - and the state - are facing a crisis.
  A Sunday Press survey showed many hotels have already run out of draught
beer, and many more are running low.
  And packaged beer is dwindling too.
  With hot weather forecast for the next few days and pre-Christmas parties
starting to get into full swing, flummoxed publicans are counting near-empty
cellars.
  Licensed grocers are in trouble, too.
  Secretary-manager of the Retail Liquor Merchants Association, Mr Bruno
Scarcella warned last night:
  "It's a very desperate situation.
  "Retailers depend on income from Christmas trade to pay licence fees,
due at the end of the year," he said.
  Seven hundred CUB workers went on strike last Monday week in a dispute
over a Christmas bonus.
  CUB workers in NSW and WA already have such a bonus - which is effectively
two weeks' pay, in contrast to a one-week pay bonus Victorian colleages
receive.
  The striking workers already have a 35-hour week, 9-day fortnight; four
weeks' annual leave with a 50 per cent holiday loading; and all overtime
worked is paid at double time (a recent introduction).
  As the effects of the strike hit home, a CUB spokesman said there was a
glimmer of hope.
  On Friday a letter outlining Carlton and United Breweries position was
sent to all striking workers.
  "The letter outlined a set of proposals by management to the workforce,"
 a CUB spokesman said last night.
  But a spokesman for the Federated Liquor and Allied Industry Employees'
Union, Mr Joe Goddard, said: "There is no immediate likelihood of the matter
being settled - next week or the week after that."
  It's not yet a case of the pub with no beer in Melbourne - but today it's
the city of publicans without cheer.
  Here's a round-up of some of the Melbourne's leading hotels:
  Hyatt, Collins St:
  Supplies "desperate" said purchasing manager Alan Cooper.  "We have a
limited supply of locally bottled beer."
  Toorak Hotel:
  "Plenty of bottled Carlton draught," said manager Graham Sutherland.
 "And Fourex and light ale on tap."
  Burvale Hotel, Nunawading.
  About a week's supply of bulk beer left, said manager Ray Jacobson.
  "We have enough bottled beer for the time being with minor restrictions.
 There's plenty of Fourex but we are short on Carlton Light."
  Anchor and Hope, Richmond:
  Fourex - no Carlton or Fosters on tap and no cans, said supervisor Anna
Conway.
  Cherry Tree Hotel, Richmond:
  Situation critical, said licensee Scot Palmer.
  "We've got no bulk beer at all.  We've been on packaged beer for the
past four or five days.
  Sandringham Hotel:  
  Barman Andrew Argent gloated:  "We got a delivery of bulk beer just before 
the strike began.
  "We've got about a dozen barrels left (400 glasses a barrel), and there's
enough cans then to last until Friday."
  Young &amp; Jackson's Swanston St:
  "It's not panic yet but we will be out of Carlton by early this week,"
 said manager Mark Freudenstein.
  Association with Bond Breweries will keep him supplied with Fourex and
Swan.
  Tankerville Arms, Fitzroy:
  Situation disastrous, said licencee Percy Jones.

<h> One week to T day </h>

<bl> By Kevin Norbury, Megan Jones and Ross Brundrett </bl>

THE State Government has just five days to stop gay rights activist Alison
Thorne returning to the classroom.
  Legal sources say the government is bound by the Equal Opportunity Board's
ruling that Ms Thorne be reinstated as a classroom teacher.
  But if the government appeals to the Supreme Court before Parliament rises
next Friday, it will gain time to "change the rules".
  Ms Thorne's return to teaching is backed by her union, the Technical Teachers
Union of Victoria.
  But school bodies and other community groups doubt she will be accepted
at any school.
  On Thursday, the Equal Opportunity Board ordered the Education Ministry
to take the necessary steps to appoint Ms Thorne to a technical school
from January 1.
  But the Premier, Mr Cain, said his Government had an obligation to parents
not allow Ms Thorne to teach children 16 and under.
  He said Ms Thorne's return to the classroom would undermine the Victorian
education system, and the Government would not let this occur.
  A senior government legal source said the Government would have to amend
the Equal Opportunity Act or the Teaching Service Act if it wanted to block
Ms Thorne's return.
  Ms Thorne, 27, was withdrawn from classroom duties at Glenroy Technical
School three years ago after she spoke, on Derryn Hinch's 3AW program, in
favor of lowering the age of consent.
  She was transferred to an administrative job in the Education Department's
regional office.
  In July last year, Ms Thorne lodged a discrimination complaint against
the Education Department - now the ministry.
  A lawyer working on equal opportunity cases said yesterday that once the
government lodged an appeal, the reinstatement order would be held in suspense.
   An amendment could then be in force by the time the appeal was heard.
  If the Government does not appeal, Ms Thorne will re-start her teaching
career in the new year, most likely at Tottenham Technical School, or back
at Glenroy.
  Back in November, 1983, she was waiting to transfer from Glenroy to
Tottenham, where she had been promoted.
  How she would be received now at Tottenham Tech, the school wasn't about
to say.
  Staff and the school parent's club were tight-lipped about the possibility on
Friday.
  But sources close to Glenroy Technical School say she would not be welcome
back there.
  They said the school was still reeling from the media attention it copped
when Ms Thorne was removed from teaching.
  The school's deputy principal, Mr Barry Armstrong, yesterday refused to
 comment on the possibility of Ms Thorne's return.
  Glenroy Tech teacher Mrs Sonia Rutherford told the Sunday Press that
the school "was angry with Hinch's involvement at the school and we do not
want to get involved with the media again."
  Jan Dillow, president of the Technical Teachers Union of Victoria, confirmed
that Ms Thorne was officially designated to Tottenham Tech.
  "But it is up to her which school she returns to," Ms Dillow said.
  Sources said Glenroy Tech, and a number of other technical schools, was
already over-supplied with teachers.
 Ms Dillow said the Department of Education looked at enrolment figures
at the beginning of each school year.
  If the figures were "over-establishment", or there were more teachers
than department ratios permitted, teachers were transferred to other suitable
schools in the area, if possible.
  If there were not enough jobs to go round, a colleague would lose their
job or be transferred to accommodate Ms Thorne if she is allowed to take
up her option at Glenroy Tech.
  Ms Dillow endorsed the Equal Opportunity Board's directive that Ms Thorne
be put back into the class room.
  "It was our policy that Alison be reinstated," she said.

 <h> Rural anger brewing over compulsory tachos </h>

<bl> By Gus De Brito </bl>

Anger over the compulsory installation of tachographs in long distance
trucks is brewing in Queensland, NSW and Victorian country areas.
  A meeting last week in Narrandera, NSW, of 35 members of the newly formed
Rural Transport Association (Riverina Branch) roundly condemned the time
and distance monitoring devices favored by the Australian Transport Advisory
Council.
  They registered concern about how they would affect rural hauliers -
particularly stockies.
  Secretary/treasurer of the Riverina branch, Mrs Mary Campbell, said this
week that RTA members were concerned about how policing of the tachographs
would affect truckers under the proposed Federal operator licensing scheme.
  She said it was feared that operators could lose their licences for years
for infringements  involving tachographs and driving hours.
  "In the country areas, it is difficult to limit driving hours," she said.
  "We are worried that farmers will refuse to load us if they feel that drivers'
hours are close to running out.
  "I don't see how they can introduce these monitoring devices for stock
carters.
  "Already, in times of drought when stock is weak, they have all sorts of
troubles.
  "It is a matter of getting stock into and out of saleyards quickly."
   Rural truckers fear that strict policing of driving hours and trip times
will dislocate longhaul country transport systems and drastically increase
operating costs and freight rates.
  The meeting was addressed by local NSW State member, Mr Jim Small.
  The association is planning a major meeting in Wagga Wagga, NSW at 1pm
on Saturday, September 27.
  The guest speaker will be West Australian Liberal Opposition backbencher,
Mr Wilson Tuckey.
  Further details are available from Mrs Campbell on (069) 73-1260.

 <h> Breath Tests Illegal </h>

Queensland Law Society has suggested the State Government's new breath testing
campaign could be illegal.
  This follows a stepped-up police blitz on drink-drivers - incorporating
a trial of the new campaign called the Reduce Impaired Driving plan.
  Police stopped about 300 drivers in a crackdown in Woodridge and Beenleigh
on Friday night.
  Thirty of them will face drink charges.
  A law society statement yesterday backs claims by leading Brisbane lawyers
the Cabinet-backed RID plan is unlawful.
  Society president Elizabeth Nosworthy's statement said:
  "The law is not clear about the circumstances under which a police officer
may stop a motorist and administer a breath test.
  "The law society believes it is important the law be clarified both for
the protection of the motorist and of the individual police officers involved.
  "If the Government proposes to go ahead with its RID program, the society
believes the Traffic Act should be amended to clearly state the rights of
the police and the motorist."
  Police intend pressing ahead with the RID trial.
  Brisbane Traffic Branch chief Cal Farrah said the trial was being conducted
quietly with only half a dozen men. 
  Supt Farrah said they would continue to pull up motorists at random,
anywhere in the city and suburbs, and request to examine licences.
  The procedure was that, if liquor could be smelled, the motorist would
be asked to leave a vehicle and step on to the footpath where police would
continue to talk to him.
  If other signs were present that the motorist could be under the influence,
a breath specimen would be requested.
  Supt Farrah said motorists last week has cooperated fully with police.
  But some police have grave doubts about the legality of the RID methods.
  They want the law changed to give police the right to breath-test at
their own discretion, without any of the mandatory provisions of the Traffic
Act.
  These proclaim either a traffic offence has to be committed, positive
indications have to be present that a driver could be under the influence
or there has been an accident.
 Police cases have been lost where people have refused to blow and later
claimed they had been stopped for no lawful reasons.
  A leading Brisbane lawyer said police apparently were being pushed into
bending the law to obtain convictions.
  It would amount really to a serious conspiracy," the lawyer said.
  He said police could legally stop a driver for a licence check.
  But the normal provisions would still apply on the requirements 
necessary*necesary before police could legally require a breath test.
  A spokesman for Police Minister Bill Gunn said the Government had legal
advice that the law would not have to be changed for the RID campaign.
  "Our advice is that spot checking is not illegal," the spokesman said. 
  He said that before the campaign proceeded some administrative difficulties
had to be worked out, such as manpower needs.

 <h>$7000 bill to run envoy's mansion </h>

Household expenses for Australia's roving Ambassador for Disarmament, Richard
Butler, are costing taxpayers about $7000 a week.
  Information tabled in Federal Parliament this week showed the 1985-86
rental for his ambassador's residence in Switzerland was $172,255 - $3312
a week.
  But its current rent is believed to be $258,000 a year - almost $5000
a week.
  Mr Butler's home was recently described in a TV report as a `small mansion
with views over Lake Geneva'.
  The cost of Mr Butler's servants was given as more than $1800 a week.
  Details of Mr Butler's expenses had been sought by Opposition MPs.
  The amount of rent was specifically sought by a Liberal backbencher
Alexander Downer - himself a former diplomat.
  Wages and costs of Mr Butler's domestic servants were $91,732 in 1985-86.
  This figure would also have increased sharply with the devaluation of the
dollar.
  The Opposition's questioning of Mr Butler's expenses has a political
edge to it as he is a former senior private secretary to former Labor Prime
Minister Gough Whitlam.
  He is unlikely to be reappointed under a coalition Government.
  But the Opposition's revised foreign affairs policy will retain Mr Butler's
position of Disarmament Ambassador.
  The yet-to-be-released policy overturns previous criticism of the post
- set up by the present Foreign Minister Bill Hayden.
  Mr Butler is not the only diplomat to attract attention.
  Australia's ambassador to the European Economic Community, Lindsay Duthie,
has raised MPs' eyebrows with his expenses.
  His residence in London is understood to rent for $270,000 a year - around
$5192 a week.

 <h> Crippling cost of car tax hike </h>

<bl> By Mike Kable </bl>

Top bracket luxury cars are worth as much now - even more for the really
opulent models - as a modern, three-bedroom, suburban home.
  They are right up there in value with inner city apartments after the
Budget's sales tax hike from 20 to 30 per cent on cars costing more than
$29,649.
  Prices have gone through the roof - with motoring's ultimate status symbol,
the Rolls Royce, now costing $235,000 and the Mercedes-Benz 560-SEC coupe
soaring to $170,879.
  Australia's car importers, distributors and dealers, - who employ 17,000
people - are incensed by what they describe as a brutal, discriminatory
attack by the Federal Government.
  The latest tax increase compounds the problems caused by the dollar's
massive devaluation and the controversial fringe benefits tax.
  And the importers are rejecting the Budget estimate that it will yield
an extra $28 million a year in taxation revenue.
  They predict it will cripple sales - which have already slumped by nearly
half - and prove counter-productive.
  The higher tax, which was imposed immediately, affects more than 70 makes
and models which command about 20,000 sales a year.
  Aimed at the imports, it has also inflated the prices of two locally-built
VIP cars, Ford's LTD and Holden's Calais Director.
  BMW Australia managing director Ron Meatchem said the latest tax rise
was madness.
  "It has wrecked our forward planning program after eight years of growth
in Australia," he said.
  "The total effective protection percentage from January 1 last year to
now has increased from 57.5 to 182 per cent.
  "Taxation has reached an absurd level.  The tax component in our 735i sedan,
which costs $90,500, is more than $45,000."
  Mr Meatchem said his parent company would make a decision soon in West
Germany about the future of its Australian subsidiary, which achieved a
1985 turnover of more than 4000 cars, but will have minus growth this year.
  The average sales tax increase over the Mercedes-Benz range is $5300, with
the least expensive four-cylinder 190E sedan at $52,864 carrying a total
sales tax component of $10,346.
  Its 560SEC coupe, at $170,879, will - if there are any buyers willing
to pay the price - net the Government $32,151 in sales tax, plus another
$40,000 in import duty, which is charged at a rate of 57.5 per cent on the
ex-factory price.
  Rolls-Royce Silver Spirit buyers will contribute nearly $100,000 to the
Treasury's coffers before driving away their $235,000 investment.
  The sales tax component alone is $44,330.63, plus $50,000 worth of duty
and several thousand dollars in stamp duty and registration charges.

 <h> Corruption issue </h>

Corruption will become a major issue in the State election campaign, State
Liberal Party president John Moore said yesterday.
  "It appears to have become the norm, rather than the exception," he said.
"The smell will not go away."
  Mr Moore, who was speaking at the launching of Liberal candidate Denver
Beanland's campaign in Toowong, said he had never seen such a sustained
period of allegations concerning corruption.
  He said a major problem was that Parliament was not permitted to probe
such allegations.
 "Say something against them and you will cop a writ, even though what you
say may well be harmless or totally true," he said.
  "People who join the National Party expect to have super-citizen rights."

 <h> Chance to be PM slips by </h>

Time and the drover's dog appear to have overtaken Bill Hayden's ambition
of becoming Prime Minister.
  Mr Hayden conceded on Budget day last week his opportunity seemed to have
been lost.
  Asked if his decision to stay in Parliament meant he was waiting to become
Prime Minister at another time, Mr Hayden settled deeper into his chair
and sighed: "Aah, no.  The grim reaper of time has started to creep up on
me from behind."
  The 53-year-old former Queensland policeman earlier had said his 25 years
in Parliament represented a lifetime career. 
  Unlike Treasurer Paul Keating, who has indicated his intention to leave
politics if the Government loses the next election, Mr Hayden said he
would stay if Labor was cast back to the Opposition benches.  
  But he did not see present Opposition Leader John Howard reaching the
prime ministership.
 "I find John Howard as the Cabbage Patch kid of Australian politics," he
said.
  "He is not to be seriously perceived as Prime Minister."
  Mr Hayden was dumped from the Labor leadership just before the 1983 election
after a successful push by Mr Hawke.
  He later congratulated the new Prime Minister by saying a drover's dog
could have won that election.
  He said this week he was now impressed by the  Government's two key
personalities - Bob Hawke and Paul Keating.
  "I'm impressed by Keating's style, his content and performance," he said.
  "And I'm impressed by the way Hawke is thinking widely and casting his
mind forward on how to grapple with these problems affecting Australia, not
just this year or next year, not just for the next election, but with a
responsibility into the future.
  "It is an exciting period we are going through, just as it's a difficult
and worrying period.  Now we are thinking.
 "We're coming up with policies and getting co-operation with the union
movement.  It's working.
  "What is Howard going to do?  He's offering confrontation again.  He's
proposing privatisation.
  "He's proposing to sack people - we're trying to save people's jobs.
  But where is the creativity about this?"

The Hawke Government faces an extremely tough challenge to stay in power,
Foreign Minister Bill Hayden said last week.
  After massive swings against the Labor Party recently the Government's
survival would depend on how Australians accepted stern budgetary measures
to repair the economy, he said.
  "Historically, the bearers of bad news have been shot, or dismembered in
some way," Mr Hayden said.

 <h> Move Over Bondy </h>

<h> Iain Murray at the helm </h>

 <bl> By Mark Oberhardt </bl>

  Destiny seems to have dictated that Australian sailing's hulk Iain Murray
would one day be the nation's best known skipper.
  Murray, now 28, has been a champion sailor for most of his life.  Now
he is on the verge of becoming an international superstar.
  That's not really surprising in an island continent.  Yachting has become
one of Australia's high profile competitor sports.
  But, as is so often the case with sports in Australia, our sailing heroes
are relatively unknown in the rest of the world.
  That changed somewhat in 1983 when Australia II took the America's Cup,
making key members of the team such as Alan Bond, Ben Lexcen and John Bertrand
household names.
  The three became national heroes overnight.
  The public's adulation of Bond, Lexcen and Bertrand must have irked Murray.
After all, he was six times world champion in the flying 18ft skiff - the
world's fastest monohull.
  Murray found he may have been big news in yachting circles, but his name
meant nothing to the average Australian.
  All that is about to change as - with the backing of West Australian
multi-millionaire Kevin Parry - Murray is poised to push the Australia
II heroes into the cupboard of yesterday's men.
  Parry has poured $20 million into his challenge for the Cup and, with
Murray's help, the dream of upsetting Bond could be realised.
  After Bond's Australia II won the 1983 challenge in Newport; Rhode Island,
and they unscrewed the America's Cup from its pedestal in the New York Yacht
Club for the first time in 132 years, it seemed the same team would be on
hand to defend the trophy off Fremantle.
  But skipper John Bertrand soon left to pursue an individual career as
a motivational guru.
  Murray had been skipper of the ill-fated Advance in Newport - a boat
so ponderous it was known to one and all as The Dog.
  When The Dog was eliminated, stripped and virtually abandoned on the
Newport waterfront, Murray and his crew took over the more competitive
Challenge II from Victoria - also eliminated, but a much faster boat.
  Right up until Australia II's final series against Liberty, Murray and
his boys gave the Aussie challenger the vital match racing practice she
so badly needed.
  As the dramatic final series moved to its breathtaking climax, Murray
and Challenge II were always on the edge of the course, lending moral support.
  Naturally, when Bertrand split, Murray thought he might have some sort
of inside running with the Bond syndicate.
  Not so, Bond snubbed one of the world's best sailors and told him he was
not wanted aboard.
  Bond's monumental mistake was Kevin Parry's gain.
  Parry, a Perth multimillionaire, saw the commercial capital Bond had
made from his America's Cup victory and thought his own burgeoning business
empire could do with a bit of the same.
  He and Murray got together and the Taskforce '87 syndicate was formed.
  Parry promised vast funds.
  Murray promised his genius and demanded complete control.
  He got it and the Kookaburra saga was born.
  Murray is a complex combination of talents.  He is a superb sailor.
  And he is a great organiser - he was a successful businessman in his
early 20s.
  He designed the fastest single-hull boats in the world - space-age-
18-footers which careered over Sydney Harbor at more than 30 knots.
  Parry had the man he needed to topple the world of 12 metre sailing.
  Murray formed a design partnership with young West Australian John Swarbrick
and former America's Cup designer Alan Payne as advisor.
  They came up with the first Kookaburra, a benchmark for Kookas II and
III - currently scaring the pants off the world's best sailors in Fremantle.
  They harnessed, without the US parent company's knowledge and with the
compliance of the Australian subsidiary, the world's most advanced yacht
computer system.
  And Murray and his boys practised.  Boy, how they practised.  Two years
of hours on the water each day, a spartan regimen, supervised diet, dawn
road runs and calisthenics.
  Now it is all beginning to pay off.
  When Murray went to the 12 metres, there were snide remarks about it being
a long way from blowing away the opposition of Sydney Harbor in an 18 footer
to the robust 25 knot Fremantle Doctor and a 30 tonne yacht.
  But a lot of people forgot Lexcen - then Bob Miller - had made his mark
in 18-footers.
  Twenty-five years ago he, like Murray, was world champion and his designs,
notably Taipan and Venom, revolutionised the class.
  A few weeks ago, before last week's first defender series began, most
people thought the Bond syndicate's $15m effort to hold the Cup would sail
straight to the final series.
  But in the opening races, Kookaburra III, skippered by Murray, has laughed
at Ben Lexcen's pride, Australia IV, and walloped the current world 12
metre champion Australia III by nearly four minutes - a huge margin.
  Parry's second string yacht Kookaburra II, sailed by Western Australia's
Peter Gilmour, also beat Australia III and went down to Australia IV only
after a fouled spinnaker set wrecked her chances.
  Suddenly Murray is the toast - and the worry - of the yachting world.
  The shy, almost retiring, Murray takes it in his stride.  Like any racehorse
trainer used to dealing with the media, he trots out such lines as "We'll
take them one at a time" or "There's a long way to go".
  But Murray admits he is pleased with the way the boats are going.
  "It's always good to get some runs on the board, otherwise you are looking
at interpretation rather than fact," he says.
  "Now we can say the boats are good and that is fact.  It was always at
the back of our minds that we may have been kidding ourselves.  Well, now
we know what we can do."
  Win, lose or draw, Murray will be around in topclass yachting for many
years to come.
  "Sailing is my life.  The more I get into boat design the more it pleases
me," he says.
  Murray is a sailing natural and from the time he began crewing Flying
Ants out of Sydney's Middle Harbor Sailing Club he showed outstanding
potential.  
  By the time he was in his early teens, Murray had designed his own Cherub
with which he snared the national championship.  He transferred to 12ft
skiffs where he again he won national titles.
  By 17, he had moved up to 18s and was world champion.
  It was his six world 18ft titles which put him on the top, but to show
he wasn't a one-trick pony he took out the 1984 world Etchell titles.
  Now he could add the America's Cup to his formidable achievements.
  "Sometimes I have to pinch myself to make certain it's not a dream. 
Only two years ago I was sitting in a bar in Hawaii trying to talk Toby
Richardson into building a 12 metre for Kevin Parry," he said.
  Those two years have brought a lot of changes for Murray, but in the next
three months the die will be cast.
  Somehow destiny seems to give an inkling that Murray will be there next
January when it comes to the showdown.

<h> Thrilling Grand Prix for world crown </h>

<h> Champions set to battle out old scores in Adelaide </h>

<bl> By Fred Knight </bl>

  The 1986 World Grand Prix Championship will be decided in a flashing
blur of speed and sound over Adelaide's now famous round-the-houses course
today.
  The race, besides resolving who will wear the world racing crown, will
also stamp Adelaide as a major venue of the international racing circuit.
  The event promises to be an even bigger success than last year's debut
which has already received the coveted*covetted Foca Award for the best Grand Prix
of the 1985 season.
  The Adelaide organisers*organisors have spared no effort to make the event even
better than last year.
  They have added many more grandstand viewing areas this year and room
for a lot more spectators, many of whom could not find a place for the race
last year.
  But almost certainly the biggest factor of this year's Grand Prix season
finale will be the fact the race will decide the 1986 world champion.
  With Alain Prost bringing his Marlboro McLaren home in second place
in Mexico, he has moved back into second place in the world championship
points standings, just one point ahead of Nelson Piquet and only six points
behind leader Nigel Mansell who finished fifth at the last race and thus failed
to wrap up the 1986 title he had been leading by 10 points.
  "It should be a fantastic race for the public with three drivers fighting
for the title," said Prost.
  Certainly all the pressure will be on Mansell and I am going into the
race completely relaxed."
  Prost is aiming to be the first driver to win the world championship two
years in succession in more than 20 years.
  Last year's Australian Grand Prix winner, Keke Rosberg, will be ending
his Formula 1 driving career in Adelaide just as ex-world champion Niki
Lauda did with the Marlboro McLaren team at the same race last year.
  Niki was leading the race when a braking*breaking problem saw him spin out of
the race and into the wall.
  One feature of the Adelaide Circuit is its "billiard-ball" smooth surface
and that's something which will certainly appeal to both the Ferrari drivers
Michele Alboreto and Stefan Johansson.
  "We have had troubles with our chassis handling on bumpy circuits so Adelaide
will hopefully give us a better chance of a win in our final race of the
season," said Alboreto.
  Certainly one driver who will be looking forward to that possibility
will be Johansson, who will be driving his last race for the Ferrari team.
  "I have had two great years with the team and it would be fantastic to
leave them with my first GP win and the first for the team this season,"
said an optimistic Stefan.
  Hopes are also high for the Minardi team members Andrea Decesaris and
Sandro Nannini to take their first points of the season after Decesaris
scored an encouraging eighth-place in Mexico the best finishing position
of the season for the Minardi Team.
  It is bound to be a nailbiting affair as Britain's Mansell takes on his
Williams team-mate, Brazilian Piquet, and Frenchman Prost in the last
desperate battle to come out on top.
  "It's going to be a terrific finale to what has been one of the best seasons
for years," Mansell said.
  The big Englishman wrecked his own chances to pull off the championship
victory earlier this month by failing to find first gear when the traffic
lights changed to green at the start of the Mexican Grand Prix.
  The gear box worked perfectly throughout the race once he got going -
in last place - and he clawed his way back to finish fifth behind Piquet.

No. 1. ALAIN PROST, 31, France.  The little Frenchman finally brought the
world championship to France in 1985.  He is by far the most successful
driver of the current era, twice finishing as runner-up (1983-84) and with
22 Grand Prix wins under his belt.  Prost is the epitome of smoothness
and a master of racecraft, and it will come as no surprise to see him retain
his hard-won title this year.
No. 2. Keke Rosberg, 37, Finland.  The McLaren might seem a bit tame after
the mega horsepower he enjoyed last year, but Keke will undoubtedly give
it everything he's got.  They don't come any braver than last year's Australian
Grand Prix winner, and only time will tell if the Fin's brutal style will
suit his new mount.
No. 3. Martin Brundle, 26, England.  Tyrrell's new high profile could mean
young lion Brundle gets his big chance this year.  Injuries have punctuated
his Formula One career so far, but nobody doubts he has the talent to go
right to the top.

 <h> Gaslights May Return To North Terrace </h>

<h> MP bids to restore the grandeur </h>

<bl> By William Reschke </bl>

  The statue of the nude Venus on North Tce may soon again be viewed in
gaslight by the gentlemen of the Adelaide Club.
  In an earlier Adelaide, the members' glowing cigar ends at the club windows
drew as much scandalised comment as the statue.
  But not for Venus alone is the new move to gaslight.
  It is a bid by Mr Legh Davis, MLC, to recapture the spirit and classic
grandeur of our boulevard.
  Mr Davis, the Opposition spokesman for the arts, considers the North
Tce precinct - "our kilometre of culture" - as an important attraction
for visitors to the city.
  "Adelaide's streets were gaslit for 50 years, from 1863 to the outbreak
of World War I in 1914," he said yesterday.
  "Elegant Windsor design gas lamps, imported from England, were used
in the city in those days.
  "A Sydney company, Australian Gas Light Company, is selling an accurate
hand-made reproduction of these lights.
  "The gas lights would be placed on both sides of the terrace between East
Tce and the Railway station.
  "They would provide effect lighting rather than illumination," Mr Davis
said.
  Old world charm, however, would not extend to the lamplighter serenading
his way through parking meters to get the place lit up, Mr Davis added.
  High technology would see it done with electronic ignition.
  Mr Davis said benefits would far outweigh the cost of buying and running
the gas lights.
  Implementing the project would require co-operation between the City Council
and the SA Gas Company.
  Mr Davis has been encouraged by the positive response to his suggestion
from the Gas Company and Adelaide's Lord Mayor, Mr Jim Jarvis.
  Mr Jarvis believes it is a commendably simple way to achieve a most effective
result.
  "You know, tourists talk with me when they have seen our city and always
it comes back to this.
  "North Tce fascinates them as a grand boulevard in the classic European
style and it is our heritage," he said.
  "As long as we get back to a real representation of what it was, I would
support it," he said.
  "Government House still has the real thing.  They are superb," Mr Jarvis
said.
  Mr Davis said he would like another old custom to return.
  "The ambience of Adelaide, its Victorian architecture and wide streets
can be further enhanced by window boxes and greenery," he said.
  "Many cities overseas add color to their streets by encouraging the use
of window boxes.
  "It was pleasing here to see again the introduction of Floral Day for
the Festival of Arts, earlier this year.
  "The floral carpet in North Tce is a particular attraction of great appeal
to visitors at Festival time."
  "Sadly, a lack of expertise and volunteers have made it difficult to
hold an annual Floral Day.
  "Skills such as this should not be lost to the Festival City."
  "Adelaide's Mediterranean climate means we are ideally placed to show
off a wide range of flowers.
  "For example, many visitors to the recent International Heritage Rose
conference commented on the extraordinary quality of roses in SA ... as
good as anything in the world," Mr Davis said.

 <h> Tiffany - Girl From Bay Makes It Big </h>

<bl> By Peter Haran </bl>

  She must have been a beautiful baby, because baby, just look at her now.
  Her name is Tiffany Rowan, an 18-year-old from Glenelg who is taking the
European fashion scene by storm.
  Tiffany's climb to the top is the stuff dreams are made of - a model success
story.
  It all started three years ago when Tiffany posed in swimwear in the Sunday
Mail.  And that edge-of-the-pool shot may have been the springboard leading
her to the catwalks of Paris.
  By any yardstick, Tiffany's climb has been meteoric.  The former Rave
Agency model first made her mark as covergirl for Dolly magazine and then
it was on to the "big smoke" of Sydney and a top model agency.
  Then things happened.  Tiffany caught the eye of some of Australia's top
fashion magazines and for eight months she adorned the pages of Harper's
Bazaar, Cleo, Cosmopolitan and Mode.
  Tiffany went on to win $1000 on the TV talent show Star Search, and became
a finalist in Face Of The '80s.
  But it was while she was filming a commercial for Philips that Tiffany
got that elusive big break. 
  The film company moved to France for final shooting near the Eiffel Tower
and Tiffany promptly signed up with one of Paris' top model agencies.
  The fuse was lit and the girl from Glenelg set the European fashion scene
on fire.
  She made the pages of the English beauty magazine The Face, the Italian
fashion publication Tempo, and the French admired her in their mass circulation
publication called Vital.
  Late last week as the temperature plunged to near zero and the rain lashed
at the window of her home in Surrey, England, Tiffany Rowan was dreaming
of a sunny day down at the Bay.
  "I really want to come home for Christmas," said the girl in a whirl.
  "It's totally miserable here."
  But the miseries of the Northern winter have to be taken in her long stride
- the importance is being in the right place at the right time.
  "Jet-setting is far from all fun," Tiffany said.
  "I've been living out of suitcases for as long as I can remember.
  "I love Australia, but if you want to work with the cream you just have
to work in Europe.  And it's fabulous for Australians over here, we are
the flavor of the month.
  "You need some advantage because the competition here is incredible."
  Tiffany's next move is a natural one in the model world - acting.  "I
enrolled in a three-year course," she said.
  "I've been running up and down the length of Britain all this month 
trying to get into acting school," she said. 
  "I eventually got enrolled for a starting next September."
  But in the meantime it's back to Paris and more work under the bright
lights - a far cry from the slim-line look 15-year-old who first made a
splash in the Sunday Mail.

<h> Music-Maker Aims For Top </h>

<bl> By John Marr </bl>

  The captivating sounds of the bouzouki have been part of the Adelaide
scene for many years, and a trip to Greece this week by a father and son
will ensure it stays that way.
  Kevin Amanatidis is an up and coming bouzouki player who is going back
to his father's birthplace to learn from the experts.
  Restaurateur and chef Basil Amanatidis will fly out of Adelaide with his
18-year-old son on Tuesday, heading for Athens.
  For Kevin, it's the chance of a lifetime.  He will enter music school
in Athens and will take specialised external bouzouki tuition.
  "Kevin probably has gone as far as he can with is bouzouki playing in
Australia - certainly Adelaide, anyway", a proud dad, Basil said.
  "Greece is where the experts are, so we will go to them".
  The bouzouki, a development of the lute and mandolin, is a traditional
Greek instrument which has soared in popularity in the West, largely because
of the exposure to Greek cafe music and its use in Greek film soundtracks.
  They are not made commercially in Australia.  Kevin's current bouzouki
is Athens-made and worth about $2500.
  Good instruments take months, sometimes years, to make, allowing for the
curing of the woods and the painstaking joining of dozens of pieces to form
the body.
  They usually are highly ornate, set with mother-of-pearl carvings and
other decoration.
  For Basil, it's a journey back to see a Greece he's not visited for about
30 years - and it's also partly a business trip.
  Having just sold his control of the kitchen at the Gothic Hotel, this
long-time chef will be looking at the popular Greek taverns and cafes to
"maybe incorporate some ideas in Adelaide".
  Kevin will be in Greece for about a year, while his father will be returning
in about six weeks.

 <h> Raffles - a winner </h>

<h> Gourmet Guide </h>

<bl> By Sol Simeon  </bl>

And now for something completely different.
  The restaurant came to us.
  As a veteran nosher around Adelaide, I have known Trevor and Cheryl Edwards
for years as providers of faultless front of house service.
  Steward Grant is a less familiar face, simply because he works behind
the scenes in the kitchen.
  They are now together as Raffles caterers.
  As they say, they handle functions from two to 200 people, business stuff
such as boardroom lunches and cocktail*cocktails parties, but also private social
stuff in way of lunch and dinner parties at home.
  They also provide a hamper picnic service for outdoor eating at $10
to $50 a head for parties of six or more.
  As the emergent and flourishing cottage industry of private caterers shows,
the advantages of this style of entertaining speak for themselves.
  Host and hostess get to sit down with the guests:  There is a BYO-like
factor too, in that using your own grog helps cover any extra costs.
  All the advantages of having expert, domestic staff on 1986 middle incomes.
  Just as Raffles is best known as that Singapore grand old hotel of empire,
with the Adelaide Raffles you briefly luxuriate back in that bygone era
of what the butler saw.
  Also, considering the service provided, they are not at all expensive.
  Prices vary, but range from $4 a head for cocktails parties, functions
from $10, and lunches and dinners from $18 a head.
  As you see from the prices adjusted as usual for two, our encounter with
the high life at home cost no more than many a restaurant meal.
  While we were being witty, debonair and sophisticated (i.e. drinking)
with the chums in the living room, the Raffles trio had arrived in professional
clobber, formal waiting and chef attire, and moved into the kitchen.
  And that was really that - in the sense that all we did from then on was
be summoned, be sat, eat, and eventually say farewell.
  And marvel at the way they had washed up and left the said kitchen spick
and span.
  They have printed menus, and a sampler of some 50 dishes would include
lemon mushrooms, beef yakitori, fillet steak with three pepper sauce, pork
with apple and calvados, chicken tarragon, lobster flambe, citrus mousse,
kahlua ice cream.
  At Mr Edwards' suggestion we had lunch of Australian salmon, smoked
loin of pork with lobster farcie and coup Mimi.
  This has been a very good year for delicious new fish tastes.
  The sea trout farmed fish pioneered by Safcol are now being seen on the
menus of top restaurants and, poached, are superb.
  The Australian salmon, from Tasmania and still very much a novelty, are
every bit as good, as delicate.
  Again, it was poached pink and succulent, and it was a great start to
life with Raffles.
  The unusual combination of smoked lamb with lobster was daring and
successful.
  The coup Mimi was a delicious confection made of avocado, strawberries
and cream.
  Also provided was fresh bread and coffee.
  They can draw on your resources but can also provide their own.
  Thanks to those earlier years of being pampered at table by Mr Edwards,
I had guessed we were in for a good time - and I was not disappointed.
  And how unfair life is.
  When in fullness of time the chums left, they were effusive in thanking
herself and myself.

 <h> Cover story in reverse for clad Amanda </h>

<h> You can't tell a woman by her clothes </h>

<bl> By Gail Williams </bl>

  CLOTHES, like manners, may maketh man, but Amanda Muggleton has discovered
they can turn a wellknown Australian actress into a nonentity.
  The former Prisoner star was swamped in publicity in 1983, when Perth
audiences swarmed to Her Majesty's Theatre to see her wearing just a towel,
in Steaming.
  She says her phone didn't stop ringing and the media made a huge fuss
of her.  But she's finding things a lot quieter playing Pauline, in The
Secret Diary of Adrian Mole, at the Regal Theatre.
  The show is a roaring success, but Amanda says if she kept a diary during
her six-week stint in Perth it would read like this:
  "MONDAY:  My one day off.  Phone didn't ring, no interviews.  Went down
to Fremantle and sat in the sun.
  TUESDAY:  Browsed around the Art Gallery, loved the Golden Summers
exhibition  The show brought the house down again.
  "WEDNESDAY:  Did a matinee, good attendance.  Not sure if the audience
got the message about Pauline's awakening.  No interviews.  Cast went to
Gobbles, F Scotts and Rumors after the show.
  "THURSDAY:  Full house, no interviews.  Am looking forward to going to
Rottnest.  Hope I'm not seasick like I was last time.  No interviews, maybe
I should take my clothes off!
  "FRIDAY:  Lady from the Sunday Times phoned.  Perhaps she heard I'm taking
my clothes off!
  Don't get Amanda wrong.  She's not going out of her way to seek publicity.
 She's just noticed Perth theatregoers are more fickle than those in the
east.
  Said Amanda:  "I think it's really weird, because last time I came here
I got such a different reception.  I would hate to think it was just because
I took my clothes off.  If that's what it takes to sell a show it's pretty
poor, don't you think?
  "In Melbourne, the show was received really well and given huge amounts
of publicity.  Here it's being received just as well, but the press don't
seem to want to know.  In Perth, I haven't been doing an awful lot apart
from the show.  I suppose you could say my whole life is spent in the
darkness of the theatre."
  Since Amanda charmed Perth audiences as the voluptuous Josie, in Steaming,
she has made three movies, and travelled through South-east Asia and China.
  "I did the movies Street Hero, with Siggy (Thornton) and Queen of the
Road with Shane Withington from A Country Practice," she said.
  When Prisoner's final episode comes up in September, Amanda will join
her former co-stars in drinking a final toast to the end of one of Australia's
most popular soapies.  But she won't shed a tear.
  I'll probably never do another soap opera," she said.  "With soaps you
get labelled as your character, not only by the public, but by people in
the industry.
  "While I was doing Prisoner I came close to getting a role in a miniseries,
but I didn't get it because the public would have identified me with Chrissie
Latham from Prisoner.
  "The stupid thing is, people doling out the work tend to look down on
soap actors because they are churning out quantity, not quality.  If only
they realised what soap operas are doing to actors - they're improving
them by making them act so much better to improve the dreadful scripts."
  Amanda, no shrinking violet, always seems to be cast in the role of the
gutsy women.
  "I've been very lucky really," she said.  "I love those roles.  I've never
had to play the ingenue, the frail heart always in tears - that's not me.
 I adore Pauline.  A lot of women are going through exactly the same things
she's experiencing.  They're torn between two worlds, the world of duty
and that of the liberated woman."
  There's a smidgeon of the flirtatious Pauline, in Amanda's bubbly
personality.  But the awakening feminist in Pauline is no stranger to Amanda.
  "I think I have myself very much together, as far as women's lib goes,"
she said.
  "I've no desire to get married or have children at this stage.
  "I seem to be surrounded by men at the moment in my personal life. 
All of them want to get married and have babies.
  "In the past, it has been the woman who wanted all of that.  Now women
are realising, like Pauline, what they have been missing out on.  Young
girls today are thinking they want to do everything but get married.
  "It's crazy - the women's liberation movement has made men want to have
the security of a wife."
  While she's in Perth, Amanda hopes to catch up with one of her greatest
fans, Monica, from Rocky Bay Village.  They met during Appealathon two
years ago.  Monica was the Appealathon child and they write regularly.

 <h> New shipment of antiques is on the way </h>

  AT THE recent Antique Show Helena Barton told me of a new shipment coming
in, so I went to Etta Antiques in Claremont for a quick preview.
  In her "Chair Room" I saw quite a number of long sets of chairs, among
them a lovely set of eight Regency dining chairs including two matching
carvers.
  Already on show is a very interesting French Boulle cabinet, inlaid with
brass and tortoise shell and beautifully finished with ormulu and brass
figureheads.
  I noted the fine marble top, and date would be approximately 1870.
  This Boulle design actually originated in Italy, but it was perfected
by Frenchman Andre Charles Boulle, cabinetmaker to Louis XIV of France and
responsible for much of the furniture at the famous Palais de Versailles.
  Some of the many other magnificent pieces I took special note of were
a lovely Edwardian mahogany drum desk with pull out writing slide, a truly
delightful Louis XVI style piece, a superb Regency flame mahogany secretaire
bookcase with delicate glazing bar tracery, spiral supports and a nice
brass inlay finish.
  Other items I noted were an 1826 Regency mahogany*mahogancy chest on chest with
six full and two half drawers all fitted with brass handles, as well as
an unusually fine mahogany open top sideboard, with very nicely carved supports
and the servery above.
  This piece of furniture would in fact make an excellent drink cupboard.
  There were a couple of nice desks, the first a twin pedestal desk with
lovely red leather top in mahogany and with five or six small deep drawers
on each side, all fitted with nice brass button handles.  The second
was a small mahogany French mid 19th century hand painted kidney shaped
seven drawer desk, one of those elegant small pieces not often seen.
  Finally there was also a rare George III secretaire, a very fine piece
with cross banded doors.
  It virtually leaves me no room to describe some of the very fine pieces
of jewellery and porcelain also on display at Etta Antiques in Claremont.

<h> Dynamic road to more success </h>

<h> Enjoy life and become wealthy through `love' </h>

<bl> By Gail Williams </bl>

  IF YOU love jogging, love yourself and love giving money away, you are
the sort of person who stands to make a fortune.
  According to publisher, Mr Colin Sisson, who is very close to becoming
a millionaire, the easiest way to prosper is by working at things you
love.
  Think of 10 of your greatest passions in life.  Mr Sisson, author of best
sellers Your Right To Riches and Rebirthing Made Easy, guarantees you
could make a fortune out of any one of your loves.
  So you love playing backgammon?  Mr Sisson would advise you to open up
a backgammon school.  If that sounds too simplistic, one hour with the
enthusiastic Mr Sisson and his wife, Kathryn, will have you thinking you
have the Midas touch, and the purse of Fortunatus.
  Before you rush off to register your needlepoint or TV-watching company,
you'd be well advised to read how Mr Sisson made a fortune.
  Mr Sisson took about an hour, punctuated regularly by the deep breaths
characteristic of this rebirthing technique, to explain how he abandoned
his carpet shampooing business and suddenly started raking in the dollars.
  No, not by sheer hard work, investing in the short-term money market,
or winning the lottery.
  Mr Sisson, 40, from New Zealand, made his money by not thinking about
making money, and by giving away what money he had.
  As a member of New Zealand's Special Air Service he found himself thinking
about the meaning of life on the battlefields of Vietnam during the 1968
Tet offensive.
  When he returned from Vietnam, he started up his own carpet shampooing
business, hoping to make a fortune.
  Hard work, long hours and a desperate desire to succeed, returned enough
money only to pay his wages - and little satisfaction.
  "I realised the problem was within myself." said Mr Sisson.  "I lacked
self esteem, which I eventually found through rebirthing techniques, martial
arts, philosophy, meditation and yoga - all things which  contributed to
my understanding that all riches are first created in the mind."
  Mr Sisson began interviewing wealthy people to find out the secret of
success and discovered they all shared similar characteristics.
  "I noticed they were all optimistic, they had faith in the future, faith
in themselves and a high self esteem.  They were all positive and really
good to be around, and all really nice people.
  "But the thing that got me was they showed integrity, and I began to
disbelieve the old myth that people get rich by ripping others off.  There
may be some who do, but they are not happy people."
  Mr Sisson said the amount of money a person has is no indication of wealth.
  "Money is only by-product of wealth he said.  "Wealth really is what's
happening in our minds and hearts.  I believe in the old adage of healthy,
wealthy and wise.  If a person chooses to be poor they are concord very rich.  If
a person is poor and resents it, that person is using energy unnecessarily.
There's more work involved in being poor than being rich."
  Mr Sisson draws on this philosophy in his weekly rebirth workshops he
holds in Exhibition Hall, Subiaco, and his prosperity seminars.
  Did he make his fortune from charging $115 per seminar and $25 per workshop?
  "No," he said.  "I don't really know where I get my money from.  Quite
often I get cheques in the mail where somebody's put a loveletter in,
saying they would like to make a contribution.
  "Tithing, the law of contribution, is one of the three laws of the 
right to riches.  The other two are the laws of attraction and accumulation.
  "Tithing is a very ancient principle of prosperity.  Whatever we give
away must come back to us - even money.
  "Whenever we contribute to prosperity, we must prosper also.  But the
idea is to give at least three-quarters to those who don't need it.
  "But we should give one-quarter to people who do need it.  This should
be done in the form of an idea - like my book - rather than money.
  By giving most of your tithings to folk who are already prosperous makes
a greater impact upon the general prosperity of the world.  They will use
the money you give them to build and create even more wealth in the world,
from which everyone benefits."
  According to Mr Sisson, the Perth millionaires he has observed also
operated on this principle.
  "People like Holmes a Court and Bond may not realise it, but they are
using these laws.  To me they are very happy, and the reason is because
they have a very high level of integrity."
 Mr and Mrs Sisson are doing a four-month stint in Perth running their
rebirthing workshops and prosperity seminars.  Rebirthing is a breathing
technique used to eliminate stress and promote relaxation.

<h> Now is the time to plan for a new lease of life </h>

RETIREMENT today does not mean retiring from life, nor it should.
  For people embarking on this stage of life, completion of paid employment
can provide many opportunities.
  Often you can do a lot of things you simply didn't have time for before,
things such as travelling, playing sport, learning new skills, community
work and many more.
  Many have already achieved a degree of financial security.
  However, the economic climate has become much less hospitable to the
retiree and it is important for those approaching this period of their lives
to educate themselves in financial management.
  Otherwise, for all the vigour and enthusiasm they bring to their plans,
they may find themselves caught in the trap of declining income.
 So first - plan ahead.
  Some of the things you may consider prior to your retirement are:
  List all your assets which you will have on retirement, for example a
house, car and savings, and liabilities such as consumer credit contracts,
home mortgage and so on;
  Work out a current budget, estimating expenditure over a 12-month period
and other expenses such as a new car or holiday;
  Find out the amount of superannuation, pension and/or lump sum to which
you will be entitled and details of other amounts which you may receive
from maturing life assurance policies, long service leave etc, at retirement.
  Once you have worked out where you stand, it would be prudent for you
to consult an independent investment adviser to determine the best spread
of investments to meet your particular financial needs throughout retirement.
  There are many types of investments available and in examining these you
need to consider such factors as:
  Security - the degree of safety of your funds, how substantial is the
investment source, is your capital guaranteed or does value rise or fall
according to market sentiment, as for example property and share markets.
 How secure are the areas in which the organisation invests.?
  Income - is the investment income producing or, is it designed to provide
long-term capital gains as a hedge against inflation?  If it is income
producing, what rate is being offered?
  Marketability - can you cash in on your investment immediately you need
the money or is it placed over a fixed period.

 <h> Help is at hand </h>

A NUMBER of government services are available to help elderly people who
need extra care, but who wish to retain independence in their own homes.
  Home nursing assistance is available to people who are chronically ill
or convalescing after hospitalisation.
  These services are run by several different organisations.
  Some are run by the local council, others by community health centres and
some by church groups.
  For advice about these services, you could ask your doctor or you could
phone your local council or the Department of Health.
  Respite care is designed to give the usual carer a break, maybe once a
week, or maybe longer for a holiday.
  It is possible to claim a "domiciliary nursing care benefit" if a chronically
ill or old person is being cared for at home.
  A doctor's certificate is necessary.
  For information and/or application forms, ask your doctor, home nursing
organisations or the Commonwealth Department of Community Services.
  Many local councils and community groups run a meals on wheels service
whereby cheap, nutritious meals are regularly delivered to people unable
to prepare their own meals.  
  The nursing care can be given by any registered nurse.
  A certificate from a doctor or nurse is often needed to qualify for this
service.
  Assistance may be available where necessary for home modification, for
example, in cases where ramps are need for wheelchair usage. Ask the Health
Department for advice. 
  Various aids and appliances are available for ill elderly people through
the Health Department.

 <h> Health care benefits worth checking out </h>

MOST health fringe benefits are available to Pensioner Health Benefits (PHB)
cardholders, with some of them being available to other pensioners.
  Depending on their income, widows, age and invalid pensioners, spouse
carers, wife's pensioners and supporting parents are eligible for a PHB
card.
  Your eligibility for the card will be assessed at the time as your
pension is being considered.
  Fringe benefits can be worth more than $20 a week, so it is well worth
checking what is available and making use of your entitlements.
  You can ask for details at the Department of Social Security.
  Some of the benefits in the area of health are as follows.
  The National Medicare scheme means that the Government pays 85 per cent
of all doctors'*doctor's bills, providing the charge is no higher than the 
schedule fee (check with your Medicare office).
  If your doctor bulk bills (that is, sends the bill directly to the
Government) you will not have to pay anything.
  If the doctor does not bulk bill, you will have to pay the extra 15 per
cent.  Many doctors who do not bulk bill for all their patients will do so for
pensioners.
  Under Medicare, free public hospital care is available to everyone.
  PHB and Health Benefit cardholders and their dependants can get those
drugs listed on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme list free of charge.
  Health Care cardholders and other pensioners whose income is too high for
a PHB card but low enough for a part pension may be eligible for a
Pharmaceutical Concession card, which means they pay a reduced charge for
a listed drug.
  It may be possible to get some assistance with spectacles, but there is
a means test.  You will need to inquire at the Department of Community Welfare. 
You will have to get the prescription from a doctor which will be covered
by Medicare.
  There may be podiatry services at reduced cost.  Your local community
health centre or your local hospital may be able to help you.
  Various aids and appliances are available from your State Health Department.
  If you want your own choice of doctor in a public hospital, you will be
charged for accommodation and you will need private insurance to meet the
cost.
  You will also need to insure yourself if you want the option of a private
hospital if you become ill.
  Sometimes the waiting lists for surgery in public hospitals are long.  
  Older people can be particularly badly affected by delays as many of their
health problems are chronic and not urgent, for example a need for hip
replacement surgery.
  If you are in hospital for longer than 35 days at the one time, unless
your doctor certifies you are in need of ongoing acute care, you will
automatically be reclassified as a "nursing home type" patient.
  In this case the law says your benefits must be reduced and you will have
to meet part of the cost.
  Private hospital insurance does not entitle you to a single room in a
private hospital.
  Single rooms are given solely on the basis of medical need - there is
no difference between Medicare and private patients.
  However, if a single room is available, and no-one else needs it, you
can request it if you are a private patient.
  You should take into account theatre fees as well as accommodation when
you are considering private insurance cover.
  Private health insurance funds will meet the cost of many extra health
care services; dental care, physiotherapy, chiropody, home nursing,
chiropractors and osteopaths are examples.
  The extent of these benefits depends on the amount of insurance you pay.
  You will need to find out the details from the various funds.
  The costs of these services are not met by Medicare unless they are available
through public hospitals.
  Private funds will also meet the cost of spectacles.
  These are not covered by Medicare, although the cost of visiting an
optometrist to have your eyes tested or to get a prescription is covered.
  All the private funds apply qualifying periods and yearly limits for
benefits.
  These conditions are imposed to stop people joining the fund for a short
time, making a big claim and then cancelling their membership.

<h> `Rolling over' pays off </h>

<bl> By PETER WEATHERHEAD, a licenced investment adviser with SBT Bank Investment
Service </bl>

APPROVED Deposit Funds (ADF) were created in 1983 as a result of the Federal
Government's decision to increase the tax liability on lump sum payments.
  By rolling over eligible termination payments into an ADF, considerable
taxation benefits can be realised.
  From 1-7-83, a flat tax rate of 30 per cent is payable whereas before
1-7-83 only 5 per cent of the service component of lump sums was included
as assessable income in the year it was received.
  An exception is made for retirees of 55 years or older where the first
$55,000 of their lump sum is taxed at 16 per cent.
  Some of the advantages of Approved Deposit Funds are:
  Tax is deferred and pre-July, 1983, concessions preserved until withdrawal
from the fund or the depositor turns 65;
  The deferred tax payment earns interest while in the ADF:
  No tax is payable on earnings while invested in the fund;
  On death, the funds are tax free to the deceased taxpayer's dependants;
  Timing of withdrawals can minimise tax liability;
  Tax concessions for withdrawals are made to a depositor after the age
of 55 years;
  Withdrawals can be made at any time, such withdrawals will be taxed at
lump sum rates which are normally well below income tax rates.
  "Rollovers" are not limited to retirees.  
  An Approved Deposit Fund can be used by any employee receiving an eligible
termination payment due to resignation or redundancy.
  The Tasmanian Banks' Approved Deposit Fund recently launched jointly by
the SBT Bank and the LBS Statewide Bank provides Tasmanians with an opportunity
to turn their lump sum superannuation or severance pay into a locally managed,
high earning, tax-protected investment scheme.
 Professional independent advice should be sought before retirement or leaving
a current employer to draw up an investment strategy which will provide
income and tax savings.
 Further information can be obtained by contacting any officer of the SBT
Bank.

<h> Where to live? </h>

WHERE to live is an important feature of most older people's lives.  Retirement
will almost certainly be a time when you reassess your housing needs.
  Jan Bowen, in her excellent guide, Know Your Rights When You Retire (Bay
Books), says the main options people should consider are:
  To continue to live in their own home.
  To buy something smaller; that is a home unit.
  To live in a rented home.
  To move to a retirement village.
  While the availability of medical care and support services is obviously
important to consider, it is worth being aware that only 8 per cent of older
people need the institutional care offered by a hostel or nursing home.
  Fifteen per cent of people need support services in their own home and
the rest (about 77 per cent) live at home just as they always have.
Moving to a unit is a popular option for those people whose families have
moved away from home.  Many units have the advantage that maintenance of
gardens, etc, is the responsibility of a manager.
  Retirement villages are a relatively new and increasingly popular
choice for retired people or people approaching retirement.  Some villages
accept residents of 50 or 55 years of age and many people are choosing to move
in and establish their lives before they retire.
  Whatever you decide to do, you will need to be aware of the laws which
apply to selling a home, or to buying a home or home unit or retirement
village unit.
 Alternatively you may need to know how the law applies to altering a home
and to renting a home.
  There are a number of government concessions to help low income earners
with housing costs.
  Even if the family has grown up and moved out, many people still prefer
to stay in the home they have always lived in.
  They might like the area and be close to family, friends, familiar shops,
library and other services, especially health services.

 <h> Big cost savings in block grazing </h>

BLOCK GRAZING has been widely adopted as a grassland management practice
by the dairy industry, but farmers involved in other grazing industries
around the country have been slower to recognise its potential.
  One exception is Tasmanian, Michael Terry, of Dairy Plains near Deloraine,
who started block grazing sheep eight years ago.
  Since then he has been actively advocating the practice, and has strong
economic backing to support his claim.
  Michael's brother, Tim, told the Grassland Society of Victoria last week
the financial gains of the system had surprised them.
  Michael, Tim, another brother Geoff, and their father Ned, run "Bankton"
a 1950 hectare property under the Great Western Tiers mountain range in
northern Tasmania.
  The sheep and cattle operation is run by Michael and the cropping and
drainage enterprise by Tim.  Geoff manages a 550 sow piggery which supplies
half of Tasmania's market pigs.
  Calculations made by Tasmanian Department of Agriculture officer, Mr Ron
McCutcheon, showed that in the Terry's situation, block-grazing cattle
could save up to $37 a head each year in feed and management costs.
  AND the cost of block-grazing sheep was 12 cents a head compared with
$2.90 a head a year that it cost before the new system was adopted.
  Mr McCutcheon's figures were based on the additional costs of running
the animals over the entire property. 
  For that reason, the cost of fertiliser was not included.
  His calculations included the cost of growing turnips and feeding hay,
which was done before block grazing was started.
  Mr McCutcheon compared the costs of running cattle before and after
the Terrys adopted block grazing.  
  He said that in the Terrys' situation, the cost of growing turnips was $69
a hectare, including labor, machinery, and seed; a total of $3450 for 50
hectares.
  And, for every hectare the Terrys sowed as turnips, a hectare was out
to pasture, which incurred an additional cost of $90 a hectare, or $4500
each year.
  To feed 2500 bales of hay out each year at $2 a bale cost $5000, so that
the total costs summed up to $12,950.
  That meant that to fatten 340 cattle, it cost $38.08 cents a head.
  Mr McCutcheon calculated the cost of installing electric fencing to
hold the 340 cattle, based on the construction of four fences with double
wires.
  The total cost was $1490, or $4.38 a head.
  However, the fencing was expected to last at least seven years which reduced
the annual cost of 63 cents a head.
  He said that while the polyflex wire had a much shorter life span, the
posts and units could last much longer, so that seven years was a conservative
average estimate. 
  Experience in Victoria suggests normal 16 gauge wire can be used.  If
using polyflex, the black-yellow coating resists ultraviolet damage longer
than the pink.
  CALCULATIONS for the sheep operation were made in the same way, and came
out at $2.90 a head a year for conventional grazing, compared with 12 cents
a head a year to block-graze them.
  At his property, "Bankton", Mr Terry block-grazes 6500 ewes and 340 cattle
over winter.
  The ewes start with small blocks when they are in early pregnancy, and
as they become more in lamb, the area is extended up to three times its
original size.
  THE size of the block required is estimated by a visual assessment of
the sheep and their condition.
  A total of 2200 ewes are run in each mob, starting on a one-hectare block
of rye-grass and clover pasture.
  The sheep are not given water.  According to Mr Terry, they get enough 
moisture from the grass.
  "They clean up the ferns, tussocks and sags, and let the grass grow," he
said.                                                               
  He begins block-grazing in the first week in May and finishes in the
last week in August, before lambing begins in September.
  Moving them every day reduces parasite problems as they get clean feed,
but the stock are still drenched at the beginning and end of the program.
  The "Bankton" sheep flock comprises 4500 Corriedales and 2000
Corriedale-Border Leicester crosses.
  The lambs are sold at four months of age in December, some being kept
back as replacement ewes.
  The Terrys breed all their replacement ewes to avoid the risks of
introducing footrot and lice.
  Between February and April each year, the Terrys buy about 650 day-old
calves, of which 200 are fostered by a dairy herd, and the rest fed by 
automatic feeders.
  The cattle are sold as two-year-olds, and about 600 cattle are fattened
and sold each year.
  This winter is the first time Michael Terry has used block grazing management
on his cattle herd, and 340 yearling Friesians were started on the program
in May.
  The cattle are moved every second day and need an outside water supply.
  AS a supplement, they also receive three large round bales of barley
straw every second day.
  While the electric fencing for the sheep flock runs off a six-volt battery,
fencing for cattle has to be run off the mains.
  Block grazing is catching on in Victoria.  There are now about 20
properties using it compared with only one two years ago.
  It won't suit all grazing properties, but even those with a water logging
problem can be improved as Tim Terry's work on sub surface drainage is
showing.  Tim says he can pay for the cost of drainage in the first year
with a crop of potatoes.  After that, potatoes, beans, peas and 10 tonne
a hectare wheat crops are all a bonus.  But more of that in coming weeks.

 <h> AN eight-year battle - then AB licence is granted </h>

AN eight-year battle to gain a private artificial breeding service
licence suddenly ended recently for Gippsland inseminator John Pollard.
  Without warning or explanation he was told to apply, yet again, for a
licence and it was granted.
  Licences to operate an AB service in Victoria are granted at the discretion
of the Minister for Agriculture and Rural Affairs.
  Since 1978, Ministers of both Liberal and Labor governments have found
it more discreet not to grant AB licences to private operators.
  John Pollard believes the injustice of withholding licences has been
recognised and the situation is being rectified.
  The Minister for Agriculture and Rural Affairs, Mr Walker, has confirmed
that issuing licences for private AB services has been reviewed.  He said
licences would be granted provided strict health and quality control
conditions were met.  DARA officers would monitor all licensed services.
  John Pollard was one of several private operators whose activities were
limited in 1978 by grouping them, without consultation, under the licence
of Elders Breeding Services.
  He said that year a meeting was held in Melbourne of some parties involved
with the artificial breeding industry but at which private inseminators were
not represented.
  FOLLOWING it, he was issued with his A grade inseminator's licence as
a subcentre of Elders and was told by the Department of Agriculture that
only one inseminator could operate from his service in any one 24-hour
period.  John was employing another inseminator at the time.
  He understood the move was made to protect the co-operative insemination
services from competition by private inseminators.
  John retaliated with a persistent eight-year campaign to have the ruling
changed.  He hounded local MPs, the Ombudsman, sought legal advice and
repeatedly approached the Ministers for Agriculture during that period.
  "At one stage, a Minister was writing letters to me addressed `Dear John',
we had had so many communications," John said.
  "I wanted a full licence which would allow me to store and pack semen
for sale and offer an unrestricted insemination service which gave farmers
freedom of choice at a competitive price." 
  JOHN's entry into the private AB field was more by accident that design.
 He trained as a commercial inseminator in 1968, then worked with the local
AB co-operative for about five years.  
  That was a sideline to working on the family dairy farm selected near 
Warragul by one of his ancestors in 1873.  
  In 1976, a couple of local farmers asked John to inseminate their cows
with some semen they had bought privately.  He obliged.  Then, before
long, the bush telegraph had spread the word that John was available and
more and more farmers sought his services.
  Before long, he had recruited another inseminator and they were both being 
kept busy.
  Then, the restriction was imposed on his business but the demand
continued.  John was joined by former Warragul AB co-op manager Henry Ziebell
and he also recruited a veterinarian to assist part-time.
  Veterinary registration automatically includes approval to inseminate.
 Officially, John and Henry worked day about and the vet provided back up.
  John said his association with Elders was quite normal.  He was able to
secure semen from any registered artificial breeding organisation in
Australia.  
  VAB Co-Op were unable to sell direct to him but John said he could get
all the VAB semen he wanted through other sources.  Now that he has been
granted a full licence, VAB are more than happy to sell to him.
  Since John's PBS Artificial Breeding Services were licensed three months
ago, he has recruited another inseminator, Trevor Wozencroft, who used to
manage a Queensland AB service.  So, PBS Artificial Breeding Services now
has three full-time inseminators, John, Henry and Trevor, and the vet still
works with them part-time.
  John still operates his service from his home on the family farm where
they milk up to 250 cows a year.
BEFORE his licence was granted, his AB service premises were inspected
to establish that the buildings were suitable.  His records system was checked
to make sure a thorough and accurate account could be kept of bulls used,
cows mated, and movement of semen could be identified and traced in case
of disease outbreak; and that semen collected from farms and stored for
farmer's private use and not for sale was handled and stored in premises
separate from those used for semen for sale.
  He had to undertake to offer his service year round and make available
to customers semen from all major suppliers.
  John said he endorsed "110 per cent" the principle of inspection and
licensing to control the standards of AB services.
ALMOST all his clients are stud breeders and mainly dairy farmers.  John
does not quite know how the stud involvement came about although he is
enthusiastic about pure breeding in cattle.
  "You can go somewhere when you are producing purebreds," he said.  "Nothing
looks better than a herd of pure Friesians or Jerseys in a paddock."
  Servicing stud breeders led him to start an on-farm semen collection service
a couple of years ago.  That is how he fills in his spare times during the
off-mating season.
  He not only collects semen and stores it for clients to use when they
want it but offers a pre-season fertility check of bulls. 
  And he is also being called upon by beef breeders for whom he provides
the artificial insemination service in a veterinary supervised synchronised
mating program.  John co-operates with veterinarians performing embryo
transplants.
  John will help farmers select AB bulls but always leave the final decision,
and responsibility for it, with them.
  He does not believe the apparent easing of licensing private artificial
insemination services in Victoria is going to produce a rush of new operators.
  The capital costs associated with bulk liquid nitrogen storages, on farm
containers, laboratory equipment and other facilities would make a newcomer
to the business think twice.
  Also, farmers are already well serviced in Victoria, indeed better than
they were in the past.  John pointed out that not too many years ago AB
services and semen were offered on a take it or leave it basis.
  Competition created by several bull farms, imported semen and new technology
which makes it easy and cheap to move semen across the world, has also led
to improved service for farmers.
  John said there were now resident representatives of VAB and Elders Breeding
Services in Gippsland competing to secure the farmer's business.
