Uluru policy change By DAVE NASON  

  The Territory Government has changed its policy on the Uluru board of
management.
  The Chief Minister, Mr Steve Hatton, told the Legislative Assembly today
he was nominating the Tourism Minister, Mr Ray Hanrahan and Conservation
Minister, Mr Terry McCarthy, to the Government's vacant position.
  Under the previous Tuxworth administration the Territory boycotted
representation in protest at the handover of Uluru National Park to Aborigines
last year.
