	<h> TO DAY </h>
	

  RADIO'S funny lady Liz Sullivan will stay at 3KZ next year despite two
attractive offers from other stations.
  The effervescent Ms Sullivan, whose breakfast partnership with Peter Meehan
rates a good second to AW's Bruce Mansfield and Darren James, has decided
to stay put.
  &quot;Yes, there have been good offers and one sounded very promising,&quot; Liz
told me. &quot;But I have made up my mind to continue at KZ next year.
  &quot;Peter and I have strong on-air chemistry and I have great affection
for my boss, Les Heil. He's been very good to me.&quot;
  However, while she was keen to chat about KZ, the usually talkative Ms
Sullivan was very tight-lipped about the source of the offers.
  I believe the excellent 1986 ratings for both KZ and the Meehan-Sullivan
breakfast team were the deciding factor.
  One of the stations involved was almost certainly 3UZ, where Ms Sullivan's
former 3XY partner Peter Harrison now does the breakfast program.
  There is also a strong whisper that another station might have been trying
to buy both the Liz Sullivan on-air talent and her knack of writing topical
comedy.
  The Meehan-Sullivan humor is one of the main reasons the pair rate so
well. They went number one in the year's second ratings survey.
  While Liz Sullivan won't name the stations romancing her, she did admit
that one offer was a very good one and &quot;was something more than just on-air
work.&quot;
