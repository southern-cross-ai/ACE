	<bl> State Round
with Tony Robertson </bl>
	


	<h> This could be the start of something big </h>
	

  LAST week Brian Burke handed Peter Dowding a double-edged sword.
  The Premier wants his Industrial Relations Minister to hack his way through
the State bureaucracy.
  Mr Dowding was given the task of implementing the Government's reform
of the Public Service and its workforce of about 95,000.
  His official title is Minister assisting the Premier on Public Service
Management. Forgetting the jargon, that means acting as troubleshooter in
a priority area for the Burke Government.
  For Peter Dowding, the appointment could be the most significant in his
political career.
  In a tough job, Mr Dowding will have the chance to show what he's made
of.
  And with Mr Burke making no secret of his desire to get out of politics
in the next few years, all eyes will be on the man acknowledged as a leading
contender for the crown.
