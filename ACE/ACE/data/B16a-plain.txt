Cars v trees  

THE Perth City Council's plan to widen Riverside Drive was questionable from
the start.

  That was even before it was known that the project might involve the
destruction of many of the majestic trees which line the foreshore.
  The council will now consider realigning the road to save some of the
threatened trees. But that would take it closer to the river and encroach
even further on recreational activity.
  The council's determination to press ahead still goes against the advice
of its own city planner and flies in the face of public submissions to the
Central Perth Foreshore Study.
  Widening Riverside Drive may not even fix the bottleneck problem it is
intended to solve: It may simply attract more traffic.
  In any event, there is more at stake here than the convenience of motorists.
The tree-lined riverfront is essential to the city's character.
  If the council had a proper regard for public opinion it would take its
whole road-widening scheme back to the drawing board.
  There must surely be a more environmentally acceptable option, such as
that proposed by Perth architect John Oldham to re-direct Riverside Drive
along the present route of Terrace Road. Why did the council reject Mr Oldham's
idea?
  It is not just a matter of keeping up appearances for the America's Cup,
important though it is to make Perth as attractive as possible for tourists.
The City's river environment must be preserved in perpetuity for West
Australians themselves.
