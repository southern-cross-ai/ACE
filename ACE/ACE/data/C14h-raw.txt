	<h> Vibrations, yes; Good, no </h>
	

MY SHIRT cuffs vibrated and my ears rang throughout Jimmy Barnes's second
concert at the Entertainment Centre last night.
  Excruciating guitar solos and the regressive, aggressive condition of
Barnes's rock left me cold despite the deafening volume.
  Barnes's Heavy Metal voice was little more than a raucous yell on this
occasion, too ragged to convey any clear emotion. His lyrics were
unintelligible, buried deep beneath four guitars.
  He and his six-piece band stormed forth in a peircing assembly of lights,
relaying &quot;Ride The Night Away&quot;, &quot;Working Class Man&quot; and other monotone dirges
from Barnes's two LPs - yet if bouncing bodies are any indication, mine is a
minority opinion.
  Barnes wore a Streetbeat T-shirt in support of the &quot;Don't drink and drive&quot;
campaign. But as he left the stage after his encore, he raised his (full) glass
in salute to his fans and made a mockery of Streetbeat's message.
  Barnes has blasted ears and lasted years.
