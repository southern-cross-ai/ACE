Bear bites off boy's arm LONDON:  

 A bear in a Scottish wildlife park last night bit off and devoured
the arm of a boy, 10.
  Police said Ross Prendergast, who also was mauled on the chest and shoulders,
put his arm into the bear's cage after he, his brother, and some friends climbed
two fences to reach it.
  The 227kg European brown bear, Jeremy, well known for his appearances in
Sugar Puffs commercials in the 1960s, is a star attraction at the Camperdown
Wildlife Centre, Dundee.
  The park was closed when the incident happened at 8 o'clock.
  Staff heard the boy's screams and rushed to help him.  Prendergast was taken
to the town's royal infirmary, where he was given emergency surgery.
  His condition was described as satisfactory.
  A hospital spokesman said his right arm had been bitten off just below
the elbow.
  The fence surrounding Jeremy's cage was 1.55 metres high.
  Prendergast's grandfather said: "He's a brave wee laddie.  He's really
quite perky.  I'm sure he'll bounce back.
  The attack was the second in 48 hours at the wildlife centre.  Earlier,
a man had been bitten by a wolf.
  Ross, his brother, Mark and six of their friends had slipped through the
fence into the centre shortly after closing time.
  Employee Angad Taha was trying to round up the children when he heard
frantic screams from the bear's enclosure.
  A stick was found nearby and officials believe Prendergast might have
been taunting the bear, described by the centre as "just a big softie.
  Mr Taha, who gave emergency first aid, was too shocked to speak about
the incident.
  A spokesman for the district council, which licenses the centre, said
he did not think the bear would be put down.
  However, an urgent inquiry has been ordered.
