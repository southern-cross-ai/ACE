Tools of the Trade CAD - the early projects  

Working on an actual project within your own office on your own CAD system is the only real test of the suitability of the system for your practice. Once the terminals arrive and everything is switched on, the pressure is really on for the people responsible for its introduction to make it perform. There you sit at the bottom of the learning curve staring at the bleeping screen and haunted by the dubious logic you iused to such good effect during the cost justification stage of the purchase. The next step you take will determine whether the system becomes a useful and valuable addition to the office, or an unwanted burden and a drain on that hard earned cash flow. No matter what you do, it is vital that as soon as is humanly possible, the system be applied to doing real work.
