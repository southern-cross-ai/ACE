	<h> Double killer `still in area' </h>
	


	<bl> By Warren Gibbs </bl>
	

  Police believe the Logan Reserve double murderer has gone to ground
in the area of his brutal attacks.
  Officer-in-charge Det. Sgt Neil Conway said today inquiries interstate
revealed nothing to indicate the man has fled Queensland.
  The killer, described as a*an &quot;frenzied maniac&quot;, was capable of killing
at anytime, and police warned of the dangers of harboring the man.
  &quot;He is callous murderer who has nothing to lose by killing again,&quot; Det.Sgt
Conway said.
  Det. Sgt Conway said inquiries were being centred on Brisbane's southside,
extending to the Gold Coast.
  Detectives have received more than 750 tip-offs from the public, but are
appealing for anyone with information to contact Beenleigh CIB.
