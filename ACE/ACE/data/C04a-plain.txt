JUST TOO BAD TO BE TRUE B-GRADE FLICK LITTLE MORE THAN AN INSULT  

JUST a few weeks after a forgettable film called Wise Guys screened briefly
in Sydney, comes Bad Guys.
  And wise guys would do well to give Bad Guys a miss. 
  Why?
  Well, if you regularly read movie reviews you will almost certainly have
come across that old cliche, "an insult to the intelligence".
  It's an expression used by stunned film critics when they come reeling
out of yet another screening of yet another B-grade bummer of a movie.
  But to describe Bad Guys as an insult to the intelligence doesn't even
come close to describing the sheer awfulness of it.
  It's a film with a thoroughly silly plot: two Los Angeles policemen (played
by Mike Jolly and Adam Baldwin) become tandem wrestling stars under the
name of the Boston Bad Guys, during a period of suspension.
  However, with leaden political overtones, they end up being the good guys
in a climactic bout with some real bad guys from Russia who are known as
the Kremlin Krushers.
  And just like the professional wrestling on television, the wrestling
in this film appears to be as carefully choreographed as a dance routine.
  You know the kind of thing I mean: One, two, three, and it's your turn
to do a somersault!
  Wrestling? Yes, well, there is an audience for professional wrestling,
American style, although it doesn't exactly win huge ratings for Channel 10.
  For me, there is absolutely no merit at all in the acting, the script,
the direction.
  There is one good thing about Bad Guys ... the end credits.
