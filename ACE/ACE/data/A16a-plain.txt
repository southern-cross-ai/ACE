All's fair in dollar chase By MARK HOOPER  

When it comes to international popularity, countries such as Libya, Cuba,
South Africa, Iran, and the Soviet Union can hardly claim to be on the western
world's Christmas card list.
  But popularity and politics count for little and profits count for much
as far as Australia's agricultural traders are concerned.
  In the past year, there have been record wheat sales to the Soviet Union
and strong wheat sales to South Africa.
  Live sheep exports to Libya resumed just last month after a 16-month recess,
and we continue to sell Iran large quantities of wheat and meat.
  And on Monday, Australia's first beef cattle export to Cuba leaves Melbourne.
  The trend is summed up by a standard line from the Australian Wheat
Board:  "We have a responsibility to market our produce wherever we can."
  The Australian-Soviet bond in wheat trade is one of the strongest in the
world and is likely to continue despite raids by Europe and the U.S. this
year.
  Australia sold 3.2 million tonnes of grain to the Soviet Union in the
marketing year just ended and there is every chance the volume will be repeated,
albeit at depressed prices.
  An AWB spokesman said the "excellent" relationship would continue because
the Soviets valued the quality and quality control standards of Australian
wheat. 
  When South Africa is short of wheat, it also relies on Australia.  Despite
the Hawke Government's high-profile anti-apartheid campaign, the AWB shipped
100,000 tonnes of wheat to South Africa this year, worth about $15 million.
  That represented about one-third of South Africa's import needs.  Canada
and the U.S. supplied the rest.  Australia could replace the U.S. as southern
Africa's major supplier if U.S. sanctions extend to wheat.  
  A shipment of 104,000 live sheep from Fremantle bound for Libya last
month represented the first such trade since May last year.
  The Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation says Libya is a developing
market and prospects for future shipments are promising.
  "A contributing factor to the resumption of trade is the attractive price
at which the Australian exporter can supply the sheep," an AMLC spokesman
said.
  The Chernobyl nuclear accident also prompted Libyan authorities to look
to Australia after they banned imports from eastern Europe.
  Iran has bought 4 million tonnes of wheat from Australia in the past
three years, and buys thousands of tonnes of mutton and lamb from us each
year.
  Iran's Agriculture Minister, Mr Abbasali Zali, was recently in Australia
"looking at areas to expand co-operation".
  The Department of Primary Industry described the sale of 670 beef cattle
to Cuba as a breakthrough.  The department said last week Cuban authorities
were also interested in buying Australian buffalo and 1500 head were being
tested in the Northern Territory for their suitability for export to Cuba.
  The department said exporters were hoping the Cuban trade would increase.
 Cuba previously imported most of its cattle from Europe and Canada.
