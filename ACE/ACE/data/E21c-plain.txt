Looking at People with Frank McCaffrey  

 Kerryn Hindmarsh has been around a long time, or so it seems. Ten years
it could be, and this young NSW South Coast distance star is still only
18.
 I remember Kerryn taking out her category in the first ever female fun
run in Australia, the Betty Cuthbert Run at Lidcombe. Kerryn was in primary
school then, and ran like an Olympian on a very hot, windy day. Since then
her name has become a household word in fun runs and NSW AAA events.
 Kerryn is coached by John Hansen, who does a great job with his young,
talented group. Tuesdays and Thursdays she does speedwork. Saturday comes
a 7-mile (11km) time-trial over hills. Wednesday it's a one-hour outing.
But Sundays are what Kerryn enjoys most - approximately 2 hours in the bush.
Being able to handle this latter run and enjoying it so much tempted Kerryn
to tackle the '86 Budget Australian Marathon, which she completed in 2:54.39.
Aerobics and some gym work help her keep supple and flexible, and make a
welcome break from running now and again.
 This remarkable young lady has taken out the Sutherland to Surf four times
in a row - 1980, '81, '82 and '83. She also won the Australian CHS
cross-country in '83.
 Kerryn just loves running and fun runs, and the wonderful people she meets
through the sport. One of her goals is to run for Australia in the Olympic
Marathon - and I reckon that could be on the cards.

 I first met Wayne Larden (see photo page 13) at Brian Sharp's Ebenezer
Camp about three years ago. He immediately impressed me by his smooth,
effortless running form and his obvious enthusiasm for running - in fact,
not just enthusiasm but downright excitement about his future.
