A CLASSIC RESTORED Lost Horizons `re-made' By MICHAEL HEALY, The Denver Post  

IT cost $5 million to film, a monstrous amount back in 1937.
  It ran for 132 minutes - until censors and distributors alike cut, edited
and truncated it.
  The film was Frank Capra's Lost Horizon.
  The distributors just wanted a shorter version, but the censors were alarmed
by its political content and anti-war message, especially during  WWII.
  And now, after 13 years of painstaking work by  Robert Gitt of the American
Film Institute, the film has been restored almost to its original entirety.
   Early in the film, Robert Conway (Ronald Colman) makes a speech about
pacifism and the evils of war and, as charmingly naive as it sounds today,
it must have grated on the nerves of those who knew that Hitler's onslaught
in Europe could only be met by force and not by passive resistance.
  When the film was shown to American troops fighting WWII, Conway's
self-doubts were snipped, as were other overtly antiwar scenes.
  Still, the movie is a wonderful adventure story and among its other stars was
Jane Wyatt.
  The restoration of the print is not complete.
  Some short scenes have been lost forever, it seems, although the sound-track
is complete.
  Gitt covers the missing footage with still photos and freeze-frame shots.
