Truckie falls out in bid to escape crash. SYDNEY:  

 The driver of this semi-trailer must have thought he was jinxed
last night.
 After his truck ran out of control and crashed into a bridge on the Hume
Highway, he tried to make a hurried exit from the cabin.
 But there was nothing but fresh air outside the truck door - the driver
fell seven metres to bushes below, with his truck still balanced precariously
on the bridge above.
  The driver was taken to hospital with minor injuries.
 Three motorists avoided serious injury after being hit in the semi-trailer's
mad scramble to right itself when it went out of control on the wrong side
of the road.
