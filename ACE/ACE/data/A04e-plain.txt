The star of Crows Nest  

For real eating pleasure, it would be hard to better Athens Star: Greek and 
seafood restaurant of Crows Nest. 
  The atmosphere is friendly and happy - thanks to owner Archie Mitsios and 
his staff - the decor cosy and charming, the food a delight.
  Specialty of the house is a Greek banquet - $16 pp for groups of four-10, 
$15 pp for bigger parties - that includes lots of delicious starters,  main 
courses of moussaka, calamari, dolmades and souvlaki, four different desserts 
and coffee.
  Upstairs is a big party room for groups of 30-150.
  For a special event, the chef will make a cake, free!
  We dined in great comfort by the light of Tiffany lampshades. Laughter and 
happy conversation helped make our meal memorable.

(seafood  vinaigrette, garlic prawns, saganaki prawns, calamari, etc).
