Arthur discharges broadside at White By Sandra Lee  

After a week in hospital, 19-year-old Arthur Ainalis was 
sympathetic to the nurses' strike.
  As he left Western General Hospital yesterday afternoon, all 
Arthur wanted to do was to get a message to the Health Minister, 
Mr White, and say goodbye to his new nursing friend.
  He was injured in a car accident last Tuesday week, and was 
admitted the next day.
  Mr Ainalis was one of the patients discharged as the hospital 
geared up for the full-scale strike today.
  When he left, he couldn't find the nurse, but was still 
intent on getting a message to the Minister.
  "Mr White should come here and work for a couple of weeks and 
then maybe he will change his mind," Mr Ainalis said.
  "The nurses are all right.
  "Even though they are on strike they still looked after us and 
they have worked really hard to help everybody.
  "I feel really sorry for them.
  "They are always running around doing this and doing that, and 
from what I've seen and heard I think they deserve more pay.
  "They are trying to do their best and I hope they get what they 
want out of the strike."
  His mother, Ritsa, believed the nurses had a point in their 
strike, but was also concerned for the sick patients having to 
leave the hospital earlier than planned.
  Mrs Ainalis said the nurses had worked extremely hard over the 
past few days and were at patients' sides as soon as they were 
called.
  About 100 patients left the hospital yesterday, but the 
critically ill and those who were unable to be moved stayed.
