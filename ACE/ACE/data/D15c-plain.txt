Thursday August 7 THE PERSISTENT PROBLEM OF GUILT PRAY  
Lord Jesus, challenge my assumptions and let me see new things in
       your word today.

 READ  
Leviticus 5:14 - 6:7.

 THINK  
Imagine three Israelites in Moses' day. One knows he cheated someone.
Another rashly made a promise but did not fulfil it. A third feels out of
fellowship with God, but cannot remember disobeying him. What should each
one do? How can their broken fellowship be restored?
  In each case, the Law says: Bring a ram as a guilt (compensation) offering
to the Lord. In the first two instances the worshipper must make restitution
with interest.
  This ram offering teaches two important lessons. First, it takes seriously
the uneasy conscience that cannot find specific cause for its restlessness,
and provides a means by which the worshippers may know that atonement has
been made. What does Hebrews 9:14 suggest as the way to deal with an uneasy
conscience?

Thank God today that Jesus' blood cleanses from ALL sin - not just conscious
sin.
  Second, it underlines the fact that sin has both a social and a spiritual
dimension. Even defrauding a neighbour (6:2-5) is seen as "unfaithfulness
to the Lord". Before the worshippers may offer the ram and be declared
forgiven, they must put right the wrong done by giving compensation to the
wronged person.
  Jesus also taught (Matthew 5:23-24) that we should not come to God in
worship without first being reconciled with others.

 ACTION  
Is there anyone today to whom you should make restitution, or with
whom you need to be reconciled? Ask God for a humble spirit. Make a telephone
call, write a letter, or visit the person, to put things right.

 MEDITATE  
Focus on Jesus, the 'Suffering Servant' as our guilt offering (Isaiah
53:10).
