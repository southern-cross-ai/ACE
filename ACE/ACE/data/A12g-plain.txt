A friend vents his anger in church By TERESA MANNIX  

  A fiery Irish priest, Father Joseph Staunton, vented his anger against
the media from the pulpit.  In one of the pews sat Mrs Ingrid and Mr Bill
Murphy - the widow and brother of the man who was the subject of yesterday's
Thanksgiving Mass.
  The tiny St Bede's Church in Red Hill, where Father Staunton is a parish
priest, was chosen for the service because an application to hold it at
the more formidable St Christopher's Cathedral at Manuka was turned down.
  Father Staunton told the congregation that a friendship had developed
between himself and Mr Justice Murphy, based on many long arguments.
  Justice Murphy was not a practising Catholic.  The service was held at
Mrs Murphy's request partly because Father Staunton had spent so much time
with her husband towards the end of his life, and partly because those who
had been close to the judge wanted to give thanks for his life rather than
to mourn his memory.
  The Member for Canberra, Mrs Kelly, attended, as did the Member for Fraser,
Mr Langmore.  There was a smattering of diplomats among the 70 or so people
but it was, generally, a very subdued affair.
  Children from St Bede's Primary School sang the hymns.  There was no
pomp and little ceremony.
  Father Staunton delivered his political sermon from the pulpit.  He told
the congregation repeatedly that he hoped that nobody in Australia would
ever again be subjected to a campaign of vilification like that directed
against Justice Murphy.
  Even the word "allegation", used by some sections of the media, was
a "despicable assumption".
  He said Justice Murphy had suffered the pain of the accusations almost
to the very end of his life.  Every new inquiry against him produced further
"agony". 
  The congregation filed out quietly at the end of the service.  Mrs Murphy
even raised a smile outside as she was hugged by sympathisers before climbing
into a waiting diplomatic car.
