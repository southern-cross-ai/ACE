Paper battle flares in Victorian nursing row MELBOURNE -  

 Victoria's 15-day nurses' strike has become a war of documents.
  The State Government and nurses tried to take the high ground yesterday
in their battle for community support by putting their cases to the public.
  The Royal Australian Nursing Federation released a negotiating document
outlining arguments on its 20 grievances.
  The Health Department said it would accede to an Industrial Relations
Commission request for more details on its stance.  
  And it placed another full-page notice in newspapers explaining its
proposals to end the dispute.
  Meanwhile, the number of hospitals hit by mass walkouts is set to reach
34 with the addition of Royal Southern Memorial yesterday, Goulburn Valley
Base and Dandenong District today, and Geelong tomorrow.
  Administrators at most hospitals said they were continuing to cope with
seriously ill and emergency patients.  But it is feared the Statewide
elective surgery waiting list may have swollen by more than 7000 to around
34,000.
