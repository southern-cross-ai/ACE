BIG $95 BARGAIN  

You don't need a passport or a load of money to get away from it all, relax 
and enjoy yourself.
  For just $95, two people can do all this:  stay overnight in a luxury suite, 
enjoy a good four-course meal (choosing from the full menu) and bottle of 
wine, dance, listen to live music and top it off with a bottle of champagne.
  This exciting package is a Fri and Sat night special in St Leonards: at the 
charming, garden-set Glenview Inn, 194 Pacific Highway.
  The charming Bellevue restaurant - where you dine very well - has an 
intimate cocktail bar adjacent.  The Bellevue opens lunch Mon-Fri, dinner 
seven nights.
  A pianist entertains Fri, a jazz trio Sat.
  Your car is parked off-street, undercover.
  Glenview, with Ian Edwards manager, is tops for social and business function 
facilities.
  The air-conditioned, garden-surrounded Garden Court in particular lends 
itself to small weddings and social do's.
  Small groups find the Tudor Room ideal while the Banquet Room is excellent 
for larger functions of all kinds.
