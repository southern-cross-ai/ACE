A FEW years ago an English cricket correspondent presented himself at the
immigration desk at Sydney Airport seeking entry to that vigorous land of
opportunity.
  The immigration officer looked him over.  He took in the Harrovian tie,
the tropical suit and the superior smile of one who was born to rule. And
he was not impressed.
  For an hour he bombarded the visitor with questions.  Then, inspiration
exhausted, he said: &quot;Do you have a criminal record?&quot;  The answer was impeccable.
 &quot;My dear old thing.  I didn't know it was still compulsory in this country.&quot;
  In one encounter the stereotypes had been served; the hostile Australian,
juggling with the chip on his shoulder, and the urbane Englishman, trumping
hostility with a deadly quip.
  But times, sad to report, are changing.  And in the months ahead the English
may look back with a certain longing to their dear, dead days of domination.
  For Australan sport is experiencing - if they will forgive the word -
a renaissance.  As Ian Chappell, that celebrated philosopher and wordsmith,
put it: &quot;Things are looking up.  We're starting to kick a few bums.&quot;
  And there is merit in his claim.  In the first Test at Old Trafford, the
Kangaroos - the Australian Rugby League team - were revealed as perhaps the
finest collection of players ever to run on to a Rugby field.
  Of course, they had certain advantages in that they were larger, faster
and considerably more skilful than our brave lads, but they did not simply
beat Great Britain; they beat them out of sight.
  When you recall the ease with which their Rugby Union team did much the
same sort of thing to all the Home Countries, you may conclude that the
Aussies have made their case with the oval ball.
