THE Sun SAYS 

ROCKDALE was always going to be a tough hurdle for the apprentice Premier,
Mr Barrie Unsworth.
  He had little time in which to find a winning formula of his own.
  The amazing thing about this by-election, and the one for Bass Hill, is
that so much could go wrong.
  The results are shattering to Labor's confidence in NSW.
  Ten years of almost uninterrupted easy-riding are over. Mr Wran took
his coat - and the coattails - with him when he quit politics.
  Federal Labor, too, is shaken. Its economic struggles are a gloomy backdrop
for any election.
  With a Federal Budget in the making, Rockdale and Bass Hill are vivid
reminders of Mr Hawke's pledge to do the right thing for the nation - even
at the risk of political defeat.
  But it would be wrong to see Barrie Unsworth as helpless political flotsam.
What went wrong for him, however, were matters of style more than substance.
  Mr Unsworth came to the Premiership in a display of power politics which
was both breath-taking and offensive to many people.
  His humbling is a lesson for machine politicians that manipulating or
intimidating each other is not the same as winning popular votes.

  Tweed Heads - home or holiday house - hurt. Certainly, an earlier decision
to live in Rockdale would have helped Mr Unsworth.

  The Premier flirted with a smiling image but quickly settled for brusqueness.

  And the monorail, not a key issue for Rockdale, helped to confirm the
Premier as more at home with back-room deals than open Government.

  Should he scrape in, Mr Unsworth will need to run a Government less by
the divine right of the NSW Labor Council than in response to popular will.

  And Opposition parties, State and Federal, have to start looking like
alternative governments if they want to benefit.

  They can't count on Labor disasters mounting to crisis point. Anti-Labor
parties have to show they possess not only hope for power but some chance
of doing a better job.
