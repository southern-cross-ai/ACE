Mini-TV series on Barlow case  

A Sydney-based film production company is to make a television mini-series
on the Barlow-Chambers hangings.
  The fledgling company, Roadshow Coote and Carroll Pty Ltd, will start work
on the series in May 1987.
  Company director, former Adelaide film producer Mr Matt Carroll, said
today the mini-series would aim to capture the "personal side" of the two
hanged men.
  It would portray the complete story from their arrest to the subsequent
hangings.
  Kevin Barlow, 28, of Adelaide, and Geoffrey Chambers, 29, of Perth, were
hanged in a Malaysian jail last month after being found guilty of possessing
179g of heroin. 
  Mr Carroll said the case had "all the ingredients to be an excellent
mini-series." 
  "An extremely large number of people in Australia followed the case in
its entirety," he said.   
  "It commanded a very large audience on television and in the Press, so
this is a natural move.   
  "It will be a very fast-moving and dramatic series if it goes ahead."
  The mini-series was still in the early research stages to establish its
viability.
  "At present we are gathering information to work out what direction we
will take," he said.
  "We intend to start casting early next year and full production in May.
