COLOMBIA VOLCANO  

All Divisions and National Headquarters have received funds
from the public for the Red Cross relief operation which
followed the tragic volcanic eruption of the "Nevado del Ruiz"
in Colombia in November 1985.
     The League of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies has
worked with the Colombian Red Cross to provide relief to the
victims of the calamity.
     Detailed Situation Reports in telex format have been
circulated to all Divisions. They outline the nature of the Red
Cross relief action.
     The Australian Government contribution to the Red Cross
programme was $300,000. The Australian Red Cross has
transferred a further $177,455.19 received from the public and
$5,000 from the Society's Overseas Assistance budget item.
     Former Colombians now living in Australia have been
particularly active in fund-raising for Red Cross and the
enclosed photograph may be of interest for Divisional
publications. Pictured from left to right are Mr Alan McLean,
Assistant Secretary General, Australian Red Cross Society
receiving a cheque from Mrs Raphaela Lopez, President of the 
Spanish Latin American Welfare Centre and Mr Reynaldo Buitrago, 
President of the Colombian Community of Victoria.
