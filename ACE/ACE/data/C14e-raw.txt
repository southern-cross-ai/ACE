	<h> Good old family entertainment </h>
	

WHEN an Eastern States critic described &quot;Frog Dreaming&quot; as &quot;the kind of
B-grade film we all remember from Saturday matinees,&quot; producer Barbi Taylor
was not at all offended.
  &quot;To be perfectly honest,&quot; she said in Perth this week, &quot;that's the kind
of entertainment we need.
  &quot;The style of film-making has changed from making wholesome family films
to films that are more violent. There's a huge gap in the market for this 
kind of `Saturday matinee' film.&quot;
  Taylor should know about markets. As a producer she's at the business
end of film-making, though she likes to exercise strong control over the
creative side as well. Post-production, when the raw elements of the film
are turned into the finished movie, is her favourite part of the process:
&quot;I find it's a pleasurable experience; actual shooting can get a little
harrowing.&quot;
  Taylor has been involved in more than 15 films since leaving Perth in
1970 to seek wider experience in the film industry. &quot;Frog Dreaming&quot; is
the latest.
  Her decision to cast Henry Thomas, the child star of &quot;E.T.&quot;, rather than
a local actor was criticised. But she defends it: &quot;He was the star of the
greatest money-making film of all time. He wanted to do `Frog Dreaming'.
Am I going to stop him?&quot;
  Thomas plays an irrepressible 14-year-old whose fascination with an
unexplored water hole leads to some frightening discoveries. The film is
described as a &quot;rites of passage&quot; for the young boy. - Mike van Niekerk
