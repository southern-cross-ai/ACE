A turn for the worse in Chile 

GENERAL Augusto Pinochet, Chile's military ruler since overthrowing the
Allende Government 13 years ago, once liked to say that he was introducing
a new era of order and stability to a troubled society. The recent dramatic
attempt on his life demonstrates just how false that boast has proved to
be in a country with a strong democratic tradition. Chileans are becoming
increasingly polarised over the future of the dictatorship now that his
intention to remain in power for life is out in the open. Last month the
septuagenarian President announced that he needed to stay on until 1998
in order to ensure that his "new order" took firm hold. Under the 1980
constitution, which stipulates that a sole government candidate must be
chosen on a straight yes or no ballot, General Pinochet has the power to
nominate himself for re-election in 1989.

  Even members of the junta from the air force and navy balked at the news
that he wants another term. For the moment, however, his support among the
military is strong. So is his backing from the bulk of the business community.
The opposition admits that it is divided and weak after so many years under
an oppressive administration. Things might have been different if General
Pinochet had recognised a national accord worked out last year between a
wide variety of political groups and given the blessing of the church. The
idea was to promote a genuinely democratic alternative in the 1989 election.
But the President has done everything he can to discredit the accord in
particular and civil protest in general on the ground that these matters
lead to unrest and instability. Several thousand political protesters were
detained in the first half of this year.

  Now General Pinochet can say that the assassination attempt merely proves
his point.
