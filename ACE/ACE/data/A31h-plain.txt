Lecturer flies in to pick up his degree  

James Lim Bian Tee flew 3500km to be in Perth today to receive his degree.
  The 56-year-old university lecturer travelled from Penang, in northern 
Malaysia, to the ceremony at the WA College of Advanced Education.
  He had been studying through the college since 1983, but had never set
eyes on the institution before.
  Mr Lim is the first overseas external student in 12 years to collect his
degree in person.
  His wife Anne, who teaches English in Penang, accompanied him.
  The round trip, with accommodation, will cost the couple about $1400, Mr
Lim estimates.
  "It's worth it," said Mrs Lim.
  "It is an honour to study here and I felt that personal contact was
important," Mr Lim said.
  He took a bachelor's degree in education at the WA CAE because it offered
a speciality in religion.
