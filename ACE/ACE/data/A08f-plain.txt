Drug judge report shakes NSW Govt  

  THE State Government was rocked today by a potentially new scandal over
the sentences handed out to drug offenders by a NSW judge.
  While the Opposition called for a judicial inquiry, Attorney-General
Mr Sheahan admitted that if suggestions made about the judge were proved
correct it would amount to "a monstrous perversion of justice".
  The row was triggered by the findings of a study of the NSW legal system,
which was funded by the Australian Criminology Research Council.
  According to the report, which was leaked to The Sydney Morning Herald,
a NSW District Court judge appeared to have exercised selective leniency
in dealing with defendants represented by a particular solicitor.
