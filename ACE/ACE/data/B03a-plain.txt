CROCODILE BITES AMERICA! 

AUSTRALIA has a new roving ambassador - the tough, laconic, and phenomenally
successful Crocodile Dundee, otherwise known as Paul Hogan.
  If the results of the film's launch in 857 theatres across Canada and
the U.S. are anything to go by, the equally tough, laconic and enormously
talented Hoges is about to become one of Australia's most affluent men.
  And Australia is also going to be all the richer because of it.
  Tourism, riding on the Croc's tail, is expected to benefit from publicity
already estimated to be worth $15 million.
  And while a lot of it will go directly to Northern Australia, it will
also benefit the economy and the rest of the country.

More than a thirsty 'roo
  In the past three weeks Hoges has travelled more miles than a thirsty
'roo. He has visited 18 major cities and given hundreds of TV, radio and
press interviews.
  And everyone of them is a plug for Australia - a positive, bright, breezy
Australia bristling with energy and talent, not the whingeing, negative
world-owes-us-a-living Australia some people seem to prefer.
  Only 22 weeks old, Crocodile Dundee is already one of the most successful
films ever shown in Australia.
  It's taking well over $1 million a week and nudging E.T. - The Extra
Terrestrial - for first place on the all-time grossing list. 
  Which isn't bad for a film that cost less than $10 million to make, a
fraction of the money Hollywood spends on its box-office extravaganzas.
  All The Daily Mirror has to say is: It couldn't have happened to a nicer
fella. Or a nicer country.
