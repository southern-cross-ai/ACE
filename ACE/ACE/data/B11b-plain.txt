More of the same  

THE balance of trade figures released yesterday show, once again, the serious
nature of the problems confronting the Australian economy.
  The much-hoped-for effects of devaluation on restricting imports has
yet to occur, while exports were sluggish. 
  Admittedly there were some seasonal factors affecting the month's figures
but no amount of statistical explanation can disguise the fact that, as
a nation, we are still spending more than we are earning. The Government
has every reason for concern and none for complacency.
