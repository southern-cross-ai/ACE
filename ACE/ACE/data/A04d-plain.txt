GREAT VALUE ITALIAN  

Aniello's Trattoria of Glebe is still one of the happiest, best-value Italian 
restaurants in Sydney.  And customers know it!
  Petite hostess Fulvia, who runs Aniello's with her brother and mother (the 
kitchen whizz!) opens the two-floor corner cottage eating spot for lunch Mon-
Fri and dinner seven nights.
  It's both licensed and BYO, with a good wine list plus house red and white 
at $4.50 a litre and $2.50 a half-litre carafe.
  The pasta is superb and low priced: entree-size around $5, main course 
around $6.80!
  Veal dishes are nearly all $6.50, a BBQ seafood platter $14 and other 
seafood is $6 - $8.50.
  For dessert, you can't say no to the wonderful liqueur-soaked torta della 
casa.
  Parties up to 70 have a great time, with menus of $16, $18 and $20 pp.
