The Sun `shows the way'  

DIRECTORS of The Herald and Weekly Times said The Sun showed there was a
strong future for newspapers.
  "We strongly believe in the future of newspapers, and plans are in place
for future expansion," they said.
  "The best example of the continuing future of newspapers is The Sun.
  "By any criteria it is an amazing success story.  An average daily
circulation in excess of 550,000 makes it an institution in Melbourne and
country towns throughout Victoria."
  Directors said The Sun was sold by 7500 newsagents and sub-agents
and home-delivered before most people rose.
  They said all afternoon newspapers were facing the difficult task of finding
answers to falling circulation.
  "Our policy is to establish The Herald as Melbourne's newspaper and this
year under the theme `Your Town - Your Paper' new sections and features
have been added," they said.
  "The Herald remains one of Australia's largest selling afternoon
newspapers, and compares favorably in circulation with most morning
newspapers."  
   Directors said that in regional areas the HWT was well represented, 
with The Weekly Times continuing to sell more than 100,000
copies a week.
  The Geelong Advertiser, The Geelong News and The Bellarine Echo all made
a major contribution to group profits, while the Bendigo Advertiser produced
a record profit, despite the depressed rural economy.
  With the acquisition of the Leader group, the HWT also became the largest
suburban newspaper publisher in Victoria.
