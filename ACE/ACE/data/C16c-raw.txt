	<h> Full marks to British crime </h>
	

  The differing attitudes of the British and the Americans towards TV crime
series is shown to good effect in two new shows premiering on Channel 9
this week.
  Bulman (Monday, 10.35pm) and Hollywood Beat (Saturday, 8.30pm) are both
entertaining.
  But they are miles apart when it comes to originality and production.
  Bulman is made by Granada Television and is up to the excellent standard
we have come to expect from British crime shows. 
  Don Henderson stars as retired police inspector George Bulman, who has
taken to a life of mending clocks in a South London antique shop.
  But his days away from the rough and tumble of the underworld and espionage
are short-numbered.
  He soon gets mixed up with Lucy McGinty (Siobhan Redmond), the daughter
of an old colleague. Lucy is a university dropout with an obsession for
criminology.
  She soon has Bulman back in harness - but this time as her partner in
a private detective agency.
  The first episode sees Bulman hot on the trail of a suspicious road accident
which turns out to be murder.

  
	<h> Froth </h>
	

  Bulman is a spin-off from the highly-successful British series Strangers,
and its 13 episodes feature some big name stars.
  On the other hand, Hollywood Beat is a typical American froth and bubble
piece about two undercover police officers working in Hollywood.
  The two colorful characters battle with their straight-laced superior
but always win through in the last reel.
  It's all so familiar you could virtually exchange the title with any of
a dozen or so American shows.
  Jack Scalia stars as Nick McCarren who fights crime with his partner Jack
Rado (Jay Acovone).
  Scalia, who played Rock Hudson's son in The Devlin Connection, is a former
all-American baseball star.
  But he isn't the only big sports name in the show. Hulking former Los
Angeles Raiders linebacker John Matuszak plays, of all things, a gay bar
owner. Give me Bulman any day, but it's highly probable Hollywood Beat will
prove more popular.
