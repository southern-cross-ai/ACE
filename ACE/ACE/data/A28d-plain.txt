Twin's death saves David LOS ANGELES:  

 An infant whose life was spared when doctors removed his doomed
twin brother from the womb has been born three months premature.
  David Moller was delivered by caesarean section and is in a critical
but stable condition at Northridge Hospital Medical Centre.
  David, who weighed 1.72 kg at birth, suffered from a condition caused
by excess body fluid.
  About 113 grams of fluid was removed from his abdomen and the rest dissipated
dropping David's weight to 0.95kg.
  David's brother was removed from the womb after he had withered to half
David's size.
  Doctors said David would probably have died if they had not removed his
brother.
