- A game in which children can shoot one another in the heart,
brain or belly with a laser beam is the fastest-selling new toy on the
Christmas lists this year.
  Lazer Tag is selling out in a day after shipments arrive at New York toy
stores.
  Last Monday 70 crates of Lazer Tag arrived at the famous F.A.O. Schwarz
store in Manhattan - and sold out in 10 minutes.
  The game involves wearing a vest, a belt and a cap with sensors placed
over the middle of the forehead, the belt buckle and the heart.
  A beam of infrared light is shot from the gun.  The sensor beeps and
flashes when it is hit by the light.
  Lazer Tag's suggested retail price is $US40.  It includes a light gun,
a sensor and a belt.  Two sets are needed to play the game with someone
else.
  The top 10 toys in order are G.I. Joe, Barbie, Pound Puppies, Teddy Ruxpin
(a bear that tells stories and was the biggest success last year), Lazer
Tag, Cabbage Patch Dolls, Transformers (movable space creatures)
Cricke*Cricket (a talking teenage girl doll), Baby Talk (a talking baby doll) 
and Mask (a series of action toys of the G.I. Joe type).
