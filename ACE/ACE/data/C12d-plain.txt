The sparkle spread broadly  MOVIES TO WATCH with Stan James  

  THE MIXTURE is a broad cross-section of styles with only a few sparkles,
and except for some classy efforts from directors Alfred Hitchcock and Bill
Wilder, the weekend offers less than the rest of the week.

 Friday  

THE LOST COMMAND (1966, AO) 8.30 p.m. ADS 7. Big-budget, spectacular action
drama set during the Algerian crisis, with an anti-war message shown through
Alain Delon as a disillusioned Frenchman and the dilemma of George Segal
as an Arab faced with a tough Choice. Anthony Quinn is dominant as a French
officer. The action comes off better than the philosophy.

BRITANNIA HOSPITAL (1983, AO) 8.30 p.m. NWS 9. A biting satire on the British
National health scheme that is crude, ruthless, shocking and not very funny.
The events are based around the 500th anniversary of a British hospital, its
staff - including a mad doctor who transplants heads - a Royal visit and a TV
reporter (Malcolm McDowell). Much of the film looks grotty and clumsy. 

THE BALLAD OF CABLE HOGUE (1970, AO) 8.30 p.m. SAS 10. There is much to enjoy
in Jason Robard's warm performance as Hogue, left to die in the desert
by his prospecting partners, and the long revenge he plans. A very different
approach from director Sam Peckinpah, as Hogue discovers water in the desert
and love with Stella Stevens, with a few bitter-sweet touches.

 Saturday  

THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO (1975,G) 8.30 p.m. NWS9. The Dumas classic of wrongful
imprisonment and revenge was first filmed in 1933 with Robert Donat. Now
it is Richard Chamberlain, in the fourth version, giving his all in a rattling
good adventure. Louis Jourdan, Trevor Howard, Donald Pleasence, Tony Curtis
and Kate Nelligan take it with a pinch of swash and a broad buckle.

THE PRIVATE LIFE OF SHERLOCK HOLMES (1970, PGR) 8.30 p.m. SAS10. One of
writer-director Billy Wilder's best and most intriguing films gives a new
view of the Sherlock Holmes legend, using satire, humor and character, about
Holmes's other life, involving women and drugs. Robert Stephens and Colin
Blakely are splendid as Holmes and Watson. Genevieve Page is stylish as
Wilder skilfully manipulates his characters to suit his clever story.

PLUTONIUM 10.20 p.m. SBS. West German thriller about stolen plutonium and
the potential disaster to ecology entwined with political drama. Charlotte
Kerr plays an investigative reporter.

 Sunday  

NORTH BY NORTHWEST (1959, G) 2 p.m. ADS 7. Alfred Hitchcock's most entertaining
adventure using Cary Grant (one of his best roles) as an advertising executive
mistaken for a spy. Several brilliant, original sequences and chases, and
grand performances from Eva Marie Saint, James Mason and Jessie Royce Landis
as Grant's mother (she was nine months younger than Grant at the time).
