INTRODUCTION TO LEVITICUS  

`Leviticus?' That's one book of the Bible I can do without! All rules and
regulations, sacrifices and seriousness. What do we want to read that for?'
Is that your reaction to this book? Then here's another question for you:
Why would we not want to learn more about the meaning underlying Jesus'
death for us?
The Israelites of the Old Testament were God's chosen people, just as the
Church is today (1 Peter 2:9) - and they were chosen for the same purpose:
to show and make known the wonderful works of God. Further, just as the
Church has the Lord Jesus Christ in her midst (is, in fact, the body of
Christ), so the Israelites had Almighty God, signified by the Tabernacle,
in their midst. But God is holy. Since holiness cannot co-exist with
uncleanness, how can God remain in the centre of a sinful and profane people
without destroying them?
This question is equally important for long-ago Israelites and for Christians
today. A study of Leviticus will help our understanding of the answer.
Throughout the book you will recognise parallels and contrasts with various
aspects of our Lord's ministry and death. Why not keep a record of all you
find? It will be very helpful when we go on to study Hebrews and the later
chapters of Luke's gospel.
And now, open your Bible and join us in our quest for understanding of these
strange practices.
