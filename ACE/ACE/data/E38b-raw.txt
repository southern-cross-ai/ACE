Since the invention of the first wheel some thousands of years ago, mankind
has become increasingly dependent on its use.
  Its evolution from a wooden disc to a wooden rim with spokes, then a
metal rimmed variety, to the metal and rubber tyred variety, has made motorised
travel faster and more comfortable.
  Today, the majority of responsible people ensure that their motor vehicles
and agricultural equipment are regularly serviced - in fact, the law insists
that our motor vehicles receive annual roadworthy check-ups - but many people,
including hobby farmers, are apt to forget the importance of maintaining
tyres at the right inflation as well as healthy tread.
  The Tyre and Rim Association (Australia) based in Melbourne produces a
Standards Manual ($15) setting out correct tyre types and load limits for
various agricultural vehicles, as well as approved rims, contours, pressures
etc. This manual is standard equipment for all tyre dealers - so one can
obtain advice from these specialists in most situations. 
  However, the &quot;do-it-yourself&quot; hobby farmer can obtain valuable information
from a manual just released by the NRMA. Although this applies mainly
to cars, the basic rules apply to other types of moving equipment.
  It points out that tyres are one of the most neglected part of a car,
so it is most important to regularly check them for wear and damage.
  Cuts or sidewall abrasions, stones or obstructions in the tread, or unusual
bulges in the tyre shape should be seen to immediately.
