25 years as top ABC show  

  Australia's best television current affairs show celebrates its 25th
birthday tomorrow night.
  Four Corners has been around since the infant days of television and it
has always set the highest standard for current affairs reporting.
  It may not have had a Sixty Minutes budget but it has always been more
than competitive in the thing that counts - getting the right story.
  A 90-minute tribute to this Australian institution goes to air on the
ABC at 8.30pm.
  Producers Andrew Olle and Bruce Belsham have compiled this special, using
75 sequences from the best Four Corners programs.
  There's Who's Who of reporting staff with Michael Charlton, John
Penlington, Mike Willesee, Caroline Jones, Chris Masters and John Temple.
  There are interviews with Australian reporters. Willesee and cameraman
David Brill recall covering a story in Vietnam when troops stopped fighting
so Brill could fix his camera.

  Here is a sample of some of the stories which feature - a Tupperware
convention. Bankstown boys involved in gang bangs, the RSL, sexual life
in a country town, Asian immigration. Queensland politics, and even
electromagnetic radiation.
  Four Corners has been the mirror of Australian life for so long it is
fascinating to see how our attitudes have changed over the years. 
Or have they?
  There are some quotable quotes from such differing personalities as Sir
Joh Bjelke-Petersen, Germaine Greer, a young John Laws, wrestler Killer
Kowoski, and even actress Vivien Leigh.
  Perhaps the best way to describe Four Corners is to steal a quote from
one of the show's originators, Bob Raymond: "What Four Corners did was to
introduce Australians to themselves."
  Happy Birthday, Four Corners. May you have many more.
