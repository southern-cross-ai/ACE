Tragic Tony makes us laugh again  

 The tragic Tony Hancock still rates as a comic genius among 30 years of
television's great funnymen.
  Englishman Hancock, who took his own life in Sydney more than a decade
ago, was one of the early heroes of radio.
  So popular was his Hancock's Half Hour it was made into an even more
successful TV series.
  He developed a pompous, cowardly, but lovable character, adored by millions
around the world.
  The ABC brings back the best of Hancock with 16 black and white shows
on Wednesday nights at 8.30.
  The first in the series is the hilarious The Blood Donor which sees Hancock
teamed up with another great, the late Sid James.
  In this episode Hancock finds if you aren't careful, what you give can
very quickly be returned.
  Some of the other Hancock classics include The Missing Page, Twelve Angry
Men, The Radio Ham and The Bedsitter.
  It's a nice trip back to the sixties for those who remember Hancock at
his best.
