Horses are not cheap  

AN article by Jane Sandilands (Oct.10), could be misleading. It suggests
that the approximate cost of a reasonable horse would be $400-$500 including
saddle and bridle.
  I would agree that it is possible to purchase a horse for $400-$500, but
the saddle and bridle would be an additional cost. A reasonable second-hand
saddle could range from $100 up, depending on quality and condition, and
a bridle with bit would cost around $25 up. In addition to this, your horse
would probably need a rug ($35) and perhaps a set of brushes ($30).
  It is suggested that the approximate monthly cost of keeping a horse
is approximately $90.
  Agistment fees vary from say $6 per week at the lowest, usually in a paddock
with little feed and many horses, but is becoming increasingly difficult
to find at this low rate.
  In addition to this, you will need to feed your horse, the amount of feed
needed depending on the amount of good green feed available, the time of year,
and the number of other stock in the paddock.
  A conservative estimate for feed (excluding agistment) would be around
$10 per week.
  With regard to shoeing it is suggested that a horse only needs shoes
once a year. In actual fact, farriers recommend that a horse is re-shod
every six to eight weeks at a cost of approximately $30 per time.
  Veterinary costs can cost anything, depending on the ailment, but vets
are certainly not cheap.
  The cost of buying and maintaining a horse is far in excess of the figure
quoted in the article.
