By Ernest Roe and Ingrid Moses III        THE REVIEW PROCESS III.1      Introduction  

   One would expect departmental review procedures to exhibit similar features
in different institutions, in much the same way as do other evaluative
procedures such as promotion, granting of study leave and allocation of
research grants.  It is normal for academics to be judged by their peers,
for evidence to be submitted by those being evaluated, for referees and
assessors to be used, for the whole exercise to be conducted through and
validated by some kind of committee system (and perhaps passing through
more than one such committee before a final decision is made).

   Those initiating, conducting or being subjected to a departmental review
face similar sets of problems and challenges: similar, but, with due observance
of the proper tradition of institutional, departmental and individual autonomy
which pervades tertiary institutions, not identical.  It can easily be
demonstrated that most departmental reviews grapple with most if not all
of the following:  the reasons for the review, its terms of reference, the
composition of the review committee, the procedures for collection of evidence,
the timing of various procedures - committee meetings, submissions, interviews,
for example - and the total time span of the review, the provision of
administrative back-up, the writing and subsequent treatment of a report,
implementation of its recommendations, and other consequences of the review.
That is not intended as a comprehensive list of all that typically happens
in a review.  But the significant point is that, however alike the problems
and challenges which departmental reviews encounter, the solutions vary
to a considerable extent.

   Thus, while it is relatively simple, after scrutiny of a number of reviews,
to say "These are the usual stages of a review" or "These are the procedural
questions people generally have to answer", it is much more difficult to
generalise about the "correct" or "best" answers.  Sometimes we shall have
to report that "In institution A they chose this committee membership, adopted
this methodology, handled the report thus, whereas in Institution B they
made very different, even opposite decisions:  and, as far as we can tell,
the two reviews were equally efficient and effective."  Nevertheless, if
this Report is to be a useful document, some generalisation must be attempted,
lightly or heavily qualified, hedged around with contingencies, wherever
the facts and our judgment seem to justify that.  In defining, however
cautiously, what seems to us from the evidence to be good practice, we accept
that individuals - and individual institutions - have chosen to take a
different path and will do so in the future.

   Procedures adopted in institutions are influenced by explicit or implicit
expectations of what role departmental reviews play.  Purposes of reviews
are discussed in section 3.  Here the more general dimensions which have
become apparent are briefly mentioned.

    (a)  formalised vs informal  
This could also be called objective versus consultative.  In some
        reviews formal channels of communication were observed, e.g.
        submissions were called, persons were invited for interviews and
        could speak to their submissions or make an oral statement. There
        were no other interactions between review committee and members
        of staff.  Contact with both the department and the institution's
        executive was restricted to official `business'.  In other reviews,
        however, members of the reviewed unit, notably the head, had continuous
        access to the review committee through consultation by phone or
        face-to-face, and were able to influence the outcome of the review
        considerably.

This leads directly to the next dimension.

    (b)  inspectorial/evaluative vs developmental/educative  
On this dimension reviewers are either evaluators or facilitators
        of change.  Some reviews put the review committee into the position
        of independent judges, who, after having collected and assessed
        evidence, passed their judgment on the department.  In
        such reviews little regard may be given to what change is feasible
        and how change can be implemented. If the institution sees the
        reviewers' function, and if the reviewers themselves see their
        function, as more developmental and educative, then reviewers will
        want to interact freely with members of the department, with the
        institution's executive, feed their impressions and preliminary
        judgments to them and engage in a continuing dialogue.  In this
        case the review process itself is educative, and change may already
        occur during the review process.

    (c)  utopian (free from resource constraints) vs realistic (resource  
        bound)
        If reviewers can assess a department and recommend for an ideal
        situation, fundamental aspects of the department, viewed over a
        longer time-span, can be addressed.  Realistic recommendations are
        normally expected when the review brief specifies that developments
        in the short run, e.g. in the next five years should be addressed,
        and that recommendations should have no resource implications (which
        in practice means should not require additional resources).

    (d)  crisis review vs regular review  
        If prompted by a crisis or a specific occurrence like change of
        headship, retirement of a professor, sharp decline in student numbers,
        reviews may be initiated with the specific task of addressing this
        situation and making suggestions on how to deal with it.  Regular
        reviews on the other hand become a normal and planned feature of
        the institution, and may pick up developments already under way
        in the department. 

    (e)  comparative within institution vs comparative across the discipline  
        The basis for comparison may be other schools or departments within
        the same institution, and may determine whether a department is
        seen as viable in size, productive, healthy and happy.  Institutional
        and public interests and how they can be reconciled may be addressed
        if comparisons are made Australia-wide across the discipline.

    (f)  review of a group vs review of individuals  
        The reputation of departments is clearly dependent on individuals,
        their teaching and research programs and their performance in these.
        In some reviews individuals and their contributions (or lack of
        them) have to be addressed, through recommendations concerning new
        positions, redirection of efforts, private and confidential reports
        to the Chief Executive.  In others, individual performance per se
        is not investigated, or at least not reported on, and the focus
        remains firmly on the department.  Generally the issue of individual
        contribution to the department cannot be avoided, but a departmental
        review report is not seen as the appropriate place to go into detail.

   Among the reviews we scrutinised were two which had unique features,
briefly described in this section.

 III.1.1     A descriptive review  

   In 1980 the Director of the (then) North Brisbane CAE submitted a proposal
which was "to evaluate the effiency and effectiveness of the academic structure
and administrative practices of the Department of Liberal Studies as they
bear on the quality of its courses and its complex service role for other
Departments."

   It was to be conducted by a team from the Centre for the Advancement
of Learning and Teaching (CALT) at Griffith University which would "work
in consultation with the Head of the Department of Liberal Studies but ...
have professional responsibility for the planning, conduct and management
of the study."

   That quotation is taken from an Agreement drawn up between North Brisbane
CAE and CALT on the conduct of the review.  The Agreement begins with an
account of what the review "will attempt to describe", and Item 1 concludes
with this statement:

   "While issues of effectiveness and efficiency will arise during the course
   of the study, and directions for change may appear, it must be recognised
   that the study is limited.  Its purpose is to describe and analyse but
   not to prescribe."

Similarly, the Introduction to the Report begins with the statement, that
"The emphasis of the review was to be on description rather than judgment."

   Other Items in the Agreement state that documents will be analysed, 50-60
people will be interviewed, including all staff of the department, that
the College will ensure the project team's access to these people, that
the study will be completed within six months, and that "every effort will
be made not to report interviews in such a way as to identify individual
sources" but that "where an individual person is identified authorisation
will be sought".

   There are therefore two unusual features in the approach to this review:
the drawing up of a formal agreement between the head of the institution
in which a department was being reviewed and the external review team,
concerning the conduct of the review; and the emphasis on description and
analysis rather than judgment and prescription.

   The review report duly presents, in considerable detail, facts and figures
about the department.  "Description" permits inclusion of evaluative comments
from others, as long as they are straight quotations.  Similarly "analysis"
permits statements with a certain judgmental flavour.  Such statements are
usually prefaced by "it is said that ...", "it is felt that ...", "some
staff say ..." and similar phrases.

   Nevertheless the emphasis remains on description throughout this very
thorough account of the Department of Liberal Studies, an account with ten
appendices giving still more basic information.  Consistent with this approach,
the review team offers no recommendations.  The assumption - and the essence
of the Agreement between institution and review team - is clearly that,
presented with this full description, the College authorities or anyone
else intimately concerned will be able to make their own evaluations.

   Unfortunately it was impossible for us to follow up this particular review.
When the review began, amalgamation of the North Brisbane CAE with two other
CAEs to form the Brisbane CAE had already been proposed, and it happened
almost immediately afterwards.  The situation was therefore radically altered
and became a situation to which the review had lost most if not all of its
relevance.

   This does not of course mean that the methodology of the review is no
longer relevant.  Neither of the two features noted here - the drawing-up
of an agreement, and a review confining itself to description - has been
adopted in other departmental reviews as far as we know, and certainly not
in those we have been scrutinising.  But they merit the attention of those
involved in or planning to undertake reviews.

   The arguments for a formal agreement with an external review team are
similar to those for explicit and detailed terms of reference discussed in
section 4 below.  Both help to make intentions explicit, to clarify
expectations, and to repudiate mystery and secrecy.  Formal agreements may
also help to ensure that an institution gets its money's worth, though that
does not seem to have been a problem in any of our other reviews. 

   "Description" and "judgment" are more clearly contrasted in discussion
of theory or principle than they are in practice.  Review reports vary,
with some more descriptive, some more judgmental.  The example from North
Brisbane CAE is an extreme example of the `descriptive' mode, making particular
efforts to avoid judgments, and making no recommmendations.  Other reviews
are largely descriptive, with judgments mainly at the end, in the form of
recommendations; and those may be cautiously phrased.  Towards the other
extreme are review reports with comparatively little description (or
presentation of data) and evaluative comments on practically every page,
leading finally to quite dogmatic recommendations.

   It appears to be the normal expectations of those initiating departmental
reviews that a review committee will "evaluate" and will make firm
recommendations.  Even the North Brisbane CAE proposal describes its principle
objective as "to evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness ..."  But this
example indicates that a review may concentrate on provision of a detailed
picture which others may then use as a basis for evaluation in the usual
judgmental sense.  The onus is on the institution, and on the department
itself, rather than on the external reviewers.

   We do not wish to recommend or to discourage descriptive reviews.  We
simply draw attention to this possibility which may, either as a matter
of principle or because of the peculiar circumstances of a review, be regarded
as the most desirable way to proceed.

 III.1.2     A developmental review  

   During 1983-84 CTEC supported an evaluation of "Surveying and Mapping
Education and Training in Queensland" through its Evaluations and
Investigations Program.  As the title clearly indicates, this was not a
departmental review.  Nevertheless it is methodologically of some interest.
