	<h> Labor facing a big battle for power </h>
	


	<bl> From Warwick Costin in Canberra </bl>
	

The Hawke Government faces an extremely tough challenge to stay in power,
Foreign Minister Bill Hayden said last week.
  After massive swings against the Labor Party recently the Government's
survival would depend on how Australians accepted stern budgetary measures
to repair the economy, he said.
  &quot;Historically, the bearers of bad news have been shot, or dismembered in
