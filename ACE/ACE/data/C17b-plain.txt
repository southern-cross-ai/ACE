Expert care for inspired music `Creation' according to Haydn  

  THE performance of Haydn's greatest, most inspired sacred work, his oratorio,
The Creation, at Winthrop Hall on Wednesday, August 20, is likely to be
an exceptional event.
  For one thing, the conductor is the noted Sydney choral expert, Peter
Seymour, and for another, the University of WA Choral Society will be joined
by the WA Symphony Orchestra.
  The ABC's new policy on its orchestras is to allow them to be involved
with local community groups.
  The society's permanent conductor, John Winstanley, has engaged three
fine soloists - Elisa Wilson, Thomas Edmonds and Gregory Yurisich.
  Miss Wilson, who has  been appearing in Falstaff, is a permanent member
of the WA Opera Company and recently was awarded third place in the Shell
aria contest in Canberra, a signal honor for the young soprano.
  Mr Edmonds is coming from Adelaide to take the tenor role and Mr Yurisich,
who is a principal with the Australian Opera and recently sang with Dame
Joan Sutherland, will be coming back to his home city for the bass part.
  Mr Seymour has been musical director of the Sydney Philharmonia Society
since 1968.
  Its choir is, in effect, the chorus for the Sydney Symphony Orchestra
and is of a very high standard, thanks to Mr Seymour's work.
  He was a founder-member of the Australian Youth Orchestra and is chairman
and musical director of the National Music Camp Association.
  During his time as music master at Sydney Grammar, the school developed
a fine musical tradition.
  Mr Seymour founded the Sydney Youth Orchestra Association in 1974 to
train young players. He also spent some years as resident conductor with
the Australian Opera.
  His untiring work for the benefit of music earned him an OBE.
  Haydn wrote the Creation in 1798-99 and it reaches heights of eloquence
rarely surpassed.
  Of particular note is the lyrical beauty sustained in the arias as well
as the power of the choruses.
