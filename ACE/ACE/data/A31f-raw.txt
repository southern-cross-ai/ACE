	<h> Pensioner loses in ticket row </h>
	


	<bl> By George Williams </bl>
	

  A single parent pensioner with a severely handicapped child has been billed
$47.50 for parking in a Subiaco street space that she helped to plan when
she worked for the council.
  Mrs Val Bokhari, of Applecross, said that she was guilty of the offence,
but the council seemed unnecessarily hard to ignore her letter which asked
for leniency.
  She had been running late for a dental appointment in Kings Road, Subiaco,
when she parked on the incorrect side of the street.
  She realised that she had broken regulations when she received a pink
slip in the mail days later demanding that she pay a $20 fine.
  She said &quot;I am a pensioner but I am determined to pay my way.
  I realised that I must have broken the parking rules and I was to pay as
soon as I could along with all the other bills.&quot;
  She delivered a cheque to the council about a month after the fine was
due.
  &quot;Next thing a letter turned up returning my cheque and including a summons
for court,&quot; she said.
  &quot;I returned the cheque to the council with a letter explaining my
circumstances - that I have debts of over $20,000 and I am on the pension.
 I said that I was guilty but I asked for a little leeway, that's all.
  &quot;Then the court bill arrived - demanding $47.50.&quot;
  Mrs Bokhari said her letter was never answered by the council.
  She said: &quot; I suppose it's almost funny that I worked for the council
for three years and one of my jobs was marking out the different parking
zones.&quot;
  She said that she had served the council well, working for less than the
usual rate of pay and that she had worked at short notice on rush jobs.
  The council had even telephoned her to ask her to work on the eve of her
wedding eight years ago.
  The Subiaco City Council town clerk, Mr Jim McGeough, declined to comment
on Mrs Bokhari's case.
