Here's a cheaper way to go skiing Cross-country skiing is gaining momentum John Turnbull reports.  

Gliding in graceful curves through sparkling, untracked snow, the speeding
figures flow effortlessly down the mountain side. Rolling hills of purest
white surround them, enormous snow dunes spreading away beneath the clear
blue sky. There are few trees here, so far above sea level, where the snowy
carpet lies so deep it hides all the bushes and rocks, creating an unblemished
landscape of great beauty.
  These skiers are far from the lift queues of the resorts, for they are
cross-country (XC) skiing, a kind of skiing new to most Australians, although
it is the world's oldest.
  European rock carvings show cross-country skiing was practised there some
4000 years ago. Archeologists have found early skis preserved in ancient
bogs - beautifully carved wooden planks which were strapped to the feet
for travel and hunting (and sometimes warfare) on winter snows too deep
for walking. Today's skis are similarly curved and shaped, but are marvels
of space-age technology - slim, super-light "planks" made from exotic fibres
such as kevlar, carbon, boron and glass, usually in two layers with cores
of low-density foam or honeycomb.
  XC equipment is much lighter than that used for downhill skiing at resorts,
where chairlifts carry people uphill so they can slide down again - "yo-yo
skiing", as XCers jokingly call it. The lighter equipment is part of the
reason XC skiers can glide with seeming effortlessness up and down hills
for hours.
  XC skis have special soles which grip when going uphill yet slide freely
downhill, enabling users to go virtually anywhere there is snow. And although
Australia's snowfields cover only a tiny fragment of the continent, that
fragment amounts to about 5000 square kilometres. In the Snowy Mountains
alone there are some 2000 square kilometres of snow country, much of it
above the tree line and thus ideal for ski-touring.
  Since XC skiers don't need resort facilities, they can roam the snow
country free of the expense which puts regular resort skiing out of many
people's reach. Uphill transport at resorts can cost about $25 per adult
a day, in addition to the travel, accommodation and equipment costs. Resorts
can also be crowded, especially at holiday times, with the associated
irritations of traffic congestion, parking hassles and queueing for lift
tickets and chairlifts.
  It's little wonder then that XC is booming, for it appeals to the
adventure-minded who want to get off the beaten track, and to those who
seek the healing solitude of the mountains far from the madding crowd.
It also appeals to parents with young children wanting to enjoy the snow
away from the crowded resort slopes. In cross-country they can relax and
ski together inexpensively at their own pace, enjoying that sharing of
experiences which should be part of family recreation.
  Also, accommodation is cheaper away from the ski resorts, XC equipment
is cheaper than downhill gear and easier to learn to use, and the XC season
is much longer than the downhill one - for the snows come earliest and stay
longest on the higher ranges where only XC skiers roam.
  The first step in sampling XC is to decide where to go. There is good
skiing in both the Victorian Alps and the Tasmanian highlands, but the
best XC terrain is in the Snowy Mountains. Much of it is accessible via
the roads from Jindabyne to the main resorts and via the road off the Snowy
Mountains Highway near Kiandra.
  Outside Jindabyne the road forks: the left branch (the Alpine Way) leads
to Thredbo Village and the Ramshed Range; the right branch leads to four
other ski villages - Charlotte Pass, Perisher Valley, Smiggin Holes and
Guthega. All are in the midst of excellent ski-touring terrain.
  Mt Selwyn, a small downhill ski centre near Kiandra, is also surrounded
by excellent touring terrain, and this northern part of the Snowy Mountains
tends to be less crowded. Nearby is an XC ski area near Cabramurra, which
has a maze of groomed XC trails used for race events. There is also an
excellent set of groomed trails in the valley east of Perisher.
  These are good places to start, but there are many areas in the snowfields
where you can park right off the road, get out of the car and ski. But don't
park contrary to signposted restrictions, nor beside icy sections of road.
  Having decided where to go, the next step is to arrange the hire of skis,
boots and poles and to obtain warm outdoor clothing. Specialised clothing
is not essential at first, apart from a good parka, though it becomes an
important safety and comfort consideration on longer tours far from shelter.
Ski gear is readily available in snowfield towns and sales staff are generally
knowledgeable.
  Many Snowy Mountains visitors hire their skis on the way through Cooma,
Jindabyne or Adaminaby. Some Cooma ski shops remain open all night during
winter weekends to serve late travellers. A good idea is to phone the Cooma
Visitors' Centre just before departure to check on snow conditions,
accommodation and hire facilities.
  The Visitors' Centre can also give information about ski lessons. If
you're a newcomer to skiing it is important to take at least one lesson.
Group lessons are inexpensive and add greatly to your skiing pleasure,
introducing you to those basic techniques of striding, stopping and turning
which you will use whenever you ski.
  XC skiing is a blend of many delightful things: the "wilderness experience",
the beauty of unspoiled mountains; the excitement of back-country adventures
which may occur only a few hundred metres from the highway; and the bush
birds and animals which often take little notice of people gliding by on
skis.
  But the departure and excitement must be tempered by reasonable caution.
The careless wanderer who becomes lost, caught in bad weather, or too tired
to get back to the car before nightfall may pay a tragic penalty in frostbitten
extremities or worse. People do die in the snowfields - although only a
few - and this is proof that the great outdoors should never be taken too
lightly.
  So stay close to civilisation or your car until you learn snowcraft, how
to make a competent snowplough turn, and how to use a map and compass well
enough to find your way back to the road after a few hours' skiing. On the
other hand, don't be so over-awed by the immensity of the mountains that
you fail to enjoy them.
  Injuries are very rare in XC skiing because back-country snow is usually
soft, and the light skis, loose-heel bindings and flexible boots impose
little strain during falls. But there are important safety rules which should
be followed.
  Never ski alone. Three people is regarded as a sensible minimum, since
one can go for help while one stays with an injured person. Never ski far
from shelter if the weather map shows a depression or cold front approaching,
or if there are signs of bad weather. Always carry a small pack containing
survival gear such as extra clothing, map and compass, trail snacks and
drinks, firelighting equipment, and a whistle for signalling.
  On longish day-tours I also carry completely weather-proof outer clothing;
a Swiss army knife for tightening loose ski bindings; quick-setting resin
and heavy tape for emergency equipment repairs; a down-filled jacket (very
warm but light) for rest in severe weather; extra mittens and a woollen
balaclava for severe wind; sunscreen lotion and protective lipstick. Other
incidentals may include binoculars and a camera.
  Such accessories usually add up to only four kilograms or so - barely
noticeable in a small daypack. However, firelighting equipment, maps and
compasses are useless unless you know how to use them, so don't blithely
wander off into the back-country without some practice first.
  Cross-country clothing has to be warm, yet has to prevent perspiration
during long periods of hill-climbing and striding, so don't wear cotton
garments (which soak up and retain moisture) or downhill ski clothing (which
is too hot fo XC).
  Damp clothing is dangerously chilling, so experienced XCers remove layers
of apparel before perspiration soaks them.
  XC outfits typically consist of an inner layer of hydrophobic underwear
(such as Lifa's polypropylene under-garments), which keeps the wearer dry
by wicking moisture away from the skin. Over this goes the next layer -
long woollen socks, knee-length knickers of snow-resistant, stretch material
for unrestricted striding, and a thin wool or synthetic skivvy, plus cap
and gloves.                            
  These two layers are sufficient for most XC skiing, with extra pullovers,
down vests or jackets being added when required during rest stops, or if
it becomes windy.
  In extreme conditions of wind and falling snow, a completely waterproof
and windproof outer shell is added, consisting of overpants, parka and
mittens, leaving only the eyes and nose to be protected by goggles and a
scarf.
  You should always use good-quality sunglasses for protection against the
glare and excessive ultraviolet.
  Eventually, if XC gets in your blood - and it is extremely addictive -
you may discover that one or more of XC's three specialised branches attract
you: racing, back-country snowcamping, or cross-country downhilling (XCD).
