	<h> WHY MORE SAY NO TO MARRIAGE </h>
	


	<bl>- BY MICHAEL O'DONNELL </bl>
	

DE-FACTO relationships are being dubbed the &quot;arrangment of the 80s&quot; by marriage
counsellors.
  Latest figures from the Bureau of Statistics show a marked decrease in
the number of people under the age of 20 getting married.
  Males under 20 made up less than one per cent of all marriages in 1985
(nine per cent in 1971) and females only 10 per cent (31 per cent in 1971).
  Mrs Gelinda Spencer of the Family Life Marriage Counselling Service, says
the figures show up the latest trend among young people.
  &quot;There is less pressure on young people to marry because they now have
the socially accepted option of living together,&quot; said Mrs Spencer.
  She said people prefer to trial a marriage-type situation first without
the commitment but added it is really a farce.
  &quot;It is not*now a real indication of how a married relationship will fare because
the individuals have the immediate option of getting out.
  &quot;My colleagues and I believe those statistics will continue to fall and
the incidence*incidents of de-facto relationships will rise,&quot; she said.
