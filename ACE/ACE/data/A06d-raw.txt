	<h> Bird racket crackdown coming </h>

  NEW measures to restrict illegal trapping of wild birds are being 
considered by the State Government. 
  This follows a National Parks and Wildlife Service survey which
discovered many more birds had been sold in retail outlets than had been bred
in captivity.  
  &quot;It is obvious many of these birds are being taken illegally from the 
wild,&quot; a spokesman for the service said. 
  The new measures being considered include setting up three classes of 
licence for bird traders instead of one. 
  The Government is also likely to introduce new penalties which
could see dealers' licences downgraded or withdrawn if they trade in illegally
captured birds. 
  Mr John Whitehouse, director of the National Parks and Wildlife
Service, also said computers would be extensively used in the battle against
illegal trading. 
  &quot;With all bird trading records on computer it is very 
simple to run cross checks to make sure dealings are above board,&quot; he said. 
  The service's officials believe popular targets for illegal trappers are 
Major Mitchell (pink) cockatoos, superb parrots, and regent parrots. 
  A spokesman for State Planning and Environment Minister, Mr Carr said changes 
would not go ahead immediately so comment from within the bird trading 
industry could be considered.
