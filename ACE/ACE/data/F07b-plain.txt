BOYFRIENDS. to have or have not.  

Guys. You can't live with them, you can't live without them. Or can you?
Being single is not the end of the world. In fact, some girls even prefer
it.
  So, you want a boyfriend. Why? Because your best friend has one and you
feel left out? Because the formal's coming up? Because you're tired of kissing
mirrors? Or maybe you feel that deep down inside you need to share your
life with a special guy.
  Mmmmm. I guess that sounds reasonable enough on the surface. No matter
what guys are like, it seems we're desperate to put up with them. In fact,
we feel our hearts will break if we can't find a guy to break our hearts.
Funny, isn't it? Why is that the idea of being single unleashes all our
hidden fears of lonely spinsterhood?
