Strange fads and fashions  

JACK Palance and his daughter, Holly, tell us more tales of the strange
and unknown on Ripley's Believe It Or Not tonight on Channel 9 at 7.30.
  Holly takes a look at the many American fads over the years, including
Kewpie dolls, hula hoops, silly putty and The Thing.
  Meanwhile, Jack is lapping it up in Greece while he investigates some
Greek villagers who walk on fire to honor their saints, and a Javanese magician
who turns a man into a horse through hypnosis and then makes him eat
lightbulbs. Enlightening?
  He will also show us a human chess game and several animal oddities.
  But on a more educational level is some amazing film of the stress athletes
place on their bodies and the development of life inside the human body.
  Then at 8.30, super sleuth Jessica Fletcher, alias Angela Lansbury, finds
herself in hot water yet again when she attends a tennis match.
  Heaven knows where this woman finds time to write her alleged books!
  Between being shot at, threatened, kidnapped and then going on to solve
these intricate crimes, she is off visiting another relation in another
town.
  Tonight she accepts honorary chairmanship of her favorite children's
charity.
  Needless to say, someone is murdered but luckily Jessica is there to
solve the mystery.
