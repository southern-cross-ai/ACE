	<h> Moves to stop Australia card </h>

 The Victorian Council for Civil Liberties has launched a campaign
to stop the introduction of the Australia card.
  It is calling on State Premiers and the Northern Territory Chief Minister,
Mr Steve Hatton, to refuse to co-operate with the card legislation.
  The legislation depends on the assistance of the State and Territory
births*birth, deaths and marriages registers and lands titles offices to 
operate.
  The council's president, Mr Ron Castan QC, said the Australia Card Bill
confirmed the council's worst fears about the effects on Australian society.
  &quot;The implications of this legislation make it much more intrusive on our
privacy than any systems existing in any European or north American country,&quot;
he said.
  There would be a de facto compulsory obligation to carry the card.
  This was despite the suggestion the legislation implied the holding
of the ID card would be voluntary.
  &quot;There will be growing unofficial use of the card to the point where
it will be difficult for most Australians to determine whether or not they
are legally obliged to produce their card,&quot; Mr Castan said.
  The Victorian council also was concerned at the way in which the Federal
Government had fudged issues*isues in the debate on the card.
  The Federal Health Minister, Dr Neal Blewett, had said the card would
deal with welfare fraud.
  But that assertion ignored evidence given to a parliamentary committee
by the Social Security Department, Mr Castan*Costan said.
  The department had said identity was a cause of fraud in less than 1 per
cent of cases and the net result of ID card checks would be zero dollars.
  &quot;The Government has ignored the enormous cost involved in having people
take time off work to have their photograph taken and gain their birth
certificates,&quot; Mr Castan*Costan said.
  &quot;It ignores the work time lost as each Australian is required to line
up to be interviewed by a public servant before being assigned a number.
  &quot;There also will be costs imposed on ordinary decent Australians when
Australia card computer errors inevitably occur.&quot;
