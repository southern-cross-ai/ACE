`POPESCOPE' A BIG BUSINESS  

FIRST came the Pope Mobile, then Pope T-shirts - and now it's the "Popescope".
  An Adelaide man has just won church approval for a cardboard and glass
periscope to enable short people in crowds to see the Pope during his visit
to Australia.
  The national papal tour office yesterday gave schoolteacher Paul Doherty
a licence for his "Popescope".
  He hopes to sell 10,000 "Popescopes" at $5 each during the papal visit.
