Corruption issue  

Corruption will become a major issue in the State election campaign, State
Liberal Party president John Moore said yesterday.
  "It appears to have become the norm, rather than the exception," he said.
"The smell will not go away."
  Mr Moore, who was speaking at the launching of Liberal candidate Denver
Beanland's campaign in Toowong, said he had never seen such a sustained
period of allegations concerning corruption.
  He said a major problem was that Parliament was not permitted to probe
such allegations.
 "Say something against them and you will cop a writ, even though what you
say may well be harmless or totally true," he said.
  "People who join the National Party expect to have super-citizen rights."
