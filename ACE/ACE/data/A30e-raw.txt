	<h>...and in KL, a birthday bargain  </h>
	

IF you're planning to be in Kuala Lumpur between now and September 30, a
penny-wise accommodation choice would be the new Shangri-La Hotel.
  As a first birthday promotion, the hotel is offering 40 per cent discounts
on rooms.  The discounts bring the price of a &quot;superior&quot; room to approximately
$60 (twin share) and a &quot;deluxe&quot; room to approximately $70.
  The discounts also apply to the larger suites in the hotel.
