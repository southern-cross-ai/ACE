In the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit  

  Do you remember what the priest (or some other minister of the Sacrament)
said when he poured the water on your head to baptize you? Most of us don't
of course because we were baptized as babies. But if we have attended a
baptism or two since then we have heard the words. And if we have received
some religious instruction we have learnt something about the Sacrament
there.
  The priest says, "I baptize you in the name of the Father, and of the
Son and of the Holy Spirit."
  The words proclaim that we have entered into a new relationship with a
God who is one, yet somehow three.
  St. John tells us that "God is love". He is a community of love. His life
is a life of love - the love of the Father for the Son and of the Son for
the Father that is somehow personified in the Holy Spirit. The relationship
between Father and Son is lived in a Spirit of love.
  By our baptism we become part of that life of love. We share in the very
life of God.
  Indeed, in baptism we become one with Jesus Christ, the beloved Son of
the Father. So, like Jesus, we are now beloved sons and daughters of the
Father. We are children of God, members of His family. Like Jesus we can
address the Father familiarly ("Abba") as He does.
  Being joined with Christ, the Son, through our baptism means that we are
called to live in the Spirit of Christ. That is to say we are called to
love the Father as Christ loves the Father and we are called to love our
brothers and sisters as fellow children of the Father. Like Christ we are
called to live in a Spirit of love - love of the Father and love of others.
Jesus said, "You must love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all
your soul, and with all your mind" and "You must love your fellow-man as
yourself" (Mt. 22:37, 39).
  Jesus also told us that He came to do the will of the Father. His whole
life was an act of love of His Father. He invites us to see the Father as
the One towards whom our whole life must be oriented. He invites us to be
His co-workers in making the Father's kingdom come on earth - that is, to
help make the world a place of peace and love.
  The Father is the loving Creator who has given us the gift of life. Our
hearts were made for Him and they will not rest, will not find fulfilment,
until they learn to love Him in return for His love of us.
  God has chosen to reveal Himself to us in terms of family relationships
- something that is part of our experience. If we haven't experienced the
love of a parent or haven't experienced what it means to belong to a loving
family, we have at least seen something of what is meant in the lives of
other people.
  This does, of course, highlight the importance of loving parents and loving
families. They give us insight and understanding of what God had in mind
in revealing Himself in terms of Father, Son and the bond (Spirit) of love
between them.
  Today we celebrate the fact that God has revealed Himself as Trinity -
Father, Son and Holy Spirit. We recall that He has invited us to share in
His intimate life of love. And we remember that He calls us, through our
baptism, to share in the work, the mission, of the Beloved Son - making
the community of His love present in our world.
