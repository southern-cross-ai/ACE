Forget revenue, just prevent accidents  

IN his report of speed camera use over the weekend (Monday, May 12), Bill
Ayres quotes Mr Reg Baker's (Assistant Commissioner Traffic) dismay "that
despite publicity a section of Nepean Highway at Seaford was still one
of the worst sections for speed".
  It would be interesting to read the accident statistics for this section,
it would appear to be relatively safe with the beach on one side and very
few intersections on the other.
  Let's hope the speed camera isn't being used as an easy revenue raiser
instead of an accident prevention device.
  I have seen speed tapes set up at the bottom of hills or just after speed
restriction signs many times.
  It would gladden my heart to see such devices set up near shopping centres,
schools, or on suburban streets - it would not be as lucrative for the
Government but maybe dangerous speedsters would be prevented from causing
accidents, which surely is better than filling quotas or making easy dollars.
