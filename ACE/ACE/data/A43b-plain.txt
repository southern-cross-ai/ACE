Help is at hand  

A NUMBER of government services are available to help elderly people who
need extra care, but who wish to retain independence in their own homes.
  Home nursing assistance is available to people who are chronically ill
or convalescing after hospitalisation.
  These services are run by several different organisations.
  Some are run by the local council, others by community health centres and
some by church groups.
  For advice about these services, you could ask your doctor or you could
phone your local council or the Department of Health.
  Respite care is designed to give the usual carer a break, maybe once a
week, or maybe longer for a holiday.
  It is possible to claim a "domiciliary nursing care benefit" if a chronically
ill or old person is being cared for at home.
  A doctor's certificate is necessary.
  For information and/or application forms, ask your doctor, home nursing
organisations or the Commonwealth Department of Community Services.
  Many local councils and community groups run a meals on wheels service
whereby cheap, nutritious meals are regularly delivered to people unable
to prepare their own meals.  
  The nursing care can be given by any registered nurse.
  A certificate from a doctor or nurse is often needed to qualify for this
service.
  Assistance may be available where necessary for home modification, for
example, in cases where ramps are need for wheelchair usage. Ask the Health
Department for advice. 
  Various aids and appliances are available for ill elderly people through
the Health Department.
