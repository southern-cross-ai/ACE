	<bl> By Kenneth Cook </bl>
	

I was hunting butterflies in Cape York Peninsula when I came
as near as I ever want to come to the violent death of a human being.
  The butterflies and any other insects I could find were for a
friend of mine who collected them commercially. I was paid a
small sum for the specimens I sent south, so small that I
calculated that if I charged my running expenses against the
project, each specimen would be costing me about $20.
  But it gave me an excuse for wandering around the bush. As the
first question everyone asks you up north is, `What do you
do?', it was more acceptable to say, `Collect insects', than,
`Write books'. Not much more respectable, just slightly more.
  I was camped in a clump of pandanus about fifty kilometres out
of Weipa one morning when I heard the sound of a motor.
  About a quarter of an hour later, a four-wheel-drive police
vehicle came down the track. The driver swung over towards me
as soon as he saw my camp. There was nothing remarkable in
that - everybody stops to talk to everybody on the Peninsula.
  Three men climbed out of the police vehicle. The first was a
tall, good-looking policeman aged about thirty, neatly dressed
in his bush uniform of shorts and shirt and wide-brimmed hat;
the other two were about the same age but dressed in rough bush
clothes and looking shifty. One of these was very well built
and tough-looking with black bushy hair, a black beard and
brutal brown eyes. The other was thin, almost bald, more or
less clean-shaven, with brutal watery blue eyes.
  `G'day,' said the policeman.
  `G'day,' I said.
  `G day, g'day,' said the two civilians.
  `G day', I said.
  There followed the inevitable long, contemplative pause.
  `Warm,' said the policeman.
  `Yes,' I said. Then added hastily, `Yeah.'
  `For this time of the year,' added the policeman in
explanation.
  `Yeah,' I said.
  Another quite long pause.
  Then the policeman got down to business, obviously embarrassed
by his own unseemly haste.
  `Seen a fellow around on foot the last couple of days?'
  `Saw a Murri over the beach the day before yesterday.' I
regretted this as soon as I said it because it then occurred
to me that the policeman was on a manhunt and I didn't want to
be an informer, at least until I knew what the man was being
hunted for.
  `No,' said the policeman, `a white bloke.'
  `On foot?' I said. You never saw a white man on foot out there.
  `Yeah,' said the policeman, `probably.'
  `No. I haven't seen any whites, on foot or otherwise. What`s he done?'
  `Nothing. Just lost. What you doing up here?'
  `Catching insects.'
  `Oh.' (Long pause.) `Getting plenty?'
  `Yeah.'
  `Good.'
  Another pause. `Seen any crocodiles?'
  `Yeah. Quite a few.'
  `In the creeks, you mean? Little fellas?'
  `Well, one was about six feet long,' I said defensively.
  `Yeah, but freshwater. Haven't seen a big estuarine croc?'
  `No. But I haven't been near the sea much.'
  `Oh, they go overland. You want to watch it while you're
camping.'
  `They ever grab anybody?'
  The policeman plucked a straw of grass and began chewing it.
`We think this bloke we're looking for might have been taken
by one,' he said. `He was camped with his mates here,' he
nodded towards the two civilians, `and went off for a stroll
by himself. Didn't come back. No sign of him since. '
  `Where was all this?'
  `About half an hour up the track from here. Anyway, if you see
him, let him know we were looking for him, will you?'
  `Sure'.
  They drove off and I continued hunting insects, keeping a wary
eye out for crocodiles. I had always thought they stuck to the
water or very close to it, and only attacked swimmers or
drinking cattle. The idea of a crocodile roaming around in the
scrub seemed as unlikely as it was disturbing. I thought the
policeman might have been pulling my leg. Queenslanders are
like that.
  Late that afternoon the policeman, whose name was Jack, called
at my camp again. The civilians weren't with him.
  `Did you find him?' I asked.
  `No. You seen anyone?'
  `No. '
  Jack squatted on one haunch in the manner of those who live
north of the Tropic of Capricorn. I tried to imitate him but
found it very uncomfortable and settled for sitting on the
ground.
  `Found his clothes,' said Jack.
  `His clothes?'
  `Yeah. Shoes, socks, shirt, pants and hat, all neatly stacked
against a tree. Must have taken them off and put them there
himself.'
  `Why?'
  `Probably wanted to cool off in a creek. There's a bit of a
creek there. Enough water to sit in.'
  `What do you think then?'
  `Croc might have got him.'
  The thought lay heavily between us for a few moments.
  `'Course, it might not have,' added Jack.
  `What else, then?'
  Jack thought. `He might have wanted to blow through. Disappear.
Make people think a croc had got him, or he had got lost or
something.'
  `Why would he want to do that?'
  Jack shrugged. `People often do. Might have been on the run,
or just wanted to get away from a wife or something. Happens
a lot. Bloke always seems to turn up, though. Get charged if
they do.'
  `What with?'
  `Public nuisance. Can't have blokes like meself tearing around
looking for people if they're not lost or dead.'
  `No. I suppose not.'
  `'Course,' said Jack reflectively, `he might've been knocked
off. Thought that yesterday. Not so sure now.'
  `Who might have knocked him off?&quot;
  `His mates,' said Jack, looking surprised that I would ask so
obvious a question. I thought about the `mates'' brutal-eyes.
  `Why?'
  He shrugged again. `People do. Might have had a row over money,
or a woman or something. It happens.'
  `What are they doing up here?'
  Jack shrugged again. `They reckon they're fishing. I think
they're probably poaching.'
  `Poaching what?'
  `Crocs. Protected, you know. Skins worth a hell of a lot of
money.'
  `But you don't think they ... knocked off ... their mate
now, eh?'
  `No. Clothes were too neatly stacked. Those two wouldn't have
got them off him as neatly as that if he was dead. Anyway,
they're not bright enough to lay a false trail like that. No,
I reckon a croc got him.'
  `Well there's not much you can do about that, is there?'
  `Probably have to get the croc.'
  `How?'
  `Oh, trail around until I find it. It'd be a pretty big one.'
  `But what's the point?'
  `Get the body back. If it's not digested. Besides, have to kill
the croc.'
  `Why? Particularly if they're protected? I mean, any big
crocodile is dangerous, isn't it? This one's not more dangerous
because it's killed a man.'
  `No. But we always kill 'em if they take somebody If we can.'
  That seemed to me like killing a tree because it dropped a
branch on somebody, but I didn't pursue the argument.
  `Anyway,' said Jack, `he might have just got himself lost and
be still wandering around, or he might have shot through.'
  `So what are your plans?'
  `Going back to get instructions from the boss,' he said,
standing up. `Be seeing you. If you happen to see him, don't
forget to tell him I'm looking for him. You'll know him because
he'll have no clothes on, probably. Be seeing you.
  `See you.'
  He dropped in again next morning, ostensibly to ask again
whether I had seen the missing man, but really because he just
liked dropping in.
  I had more or less worked the area dry for specimens, but I was
interested in hanging around to find out what had happened.
  `My boss reckons the setup's a bit crook,' he said. `I've got
to keep nosing about until I find out what did happen to the
bastard.'
  `Does your ... boss ... think it was a crocodile?'
  `Should be more signs if it was, he says. Fair enough. You see,
the creek near where his clothes were was pretty small - you
could step over it. If he was sitting in there and the croc got
him, you'd expect to find some blood and stuff on the
banks - but it might have all been washed away. Then if the croc
got him on dry land, there should be some traces around - until
the ants clean it up, of course. It's a pity he wasn't wearing
his clothes. Always something left when a stiff's been wearing
clothes.'
  `Do many people get taken by crocodiles, then?'
  `Nah. Few of the Murri kids, old people. No, people die lots
of ways out here and then the dogs and the birds and the ants
and the pigs clean 'em up pretty quickly - often don't even find
bones, but you usually get a bit of clothing. Now we got all
this bloke's clothing, but it looks as though he took
everything off himself. Even his wristwatch was in the pocket
of his pants.'
  `How exactly would a crocodile get him on dry land, or even in
a little creek? Surely he'd hear it coming.'
  `Nah. They can move like a galloping horse for a short
distance. Seen one jump out of the water over on the coast once
and run after a bloody great cow. She didn't have a chance. She
caught wind of him all right and started to gallop away, but
he ran her down, grabbed her by the back leg and dragged her
into the water. Ever seen the big lizards run? Croc's as fast
as that. Only for a short distance, though.'
  He rolled himself a cigarette. `Bloody awful animals, crocs.
The big ones. I don't know why they're protected. I nearly
walked into one last year. That's another way they get
you - they just lie doggo and you walk into them and bang!
you're gone. This one I struck wasn't hungry. He just stood up
on his hind legs and bellowed at me, like a bull. Frightened
buggery out of me.'
  `What'd you do?'
  `Blew his guts out. Makes 'em easy to kill when they rear up
like that. Belly's the softest part. You can bounce a .303 off 
their backs if you hit 'em at any sort of angle.'
  You never know how much to believe of what anybody tells you
about animals up north. I've heard dozens of stories about
snakes chasing and catching a man on a motorcycle, buffaloes
that charged and wrecked cars, pigs of unbelievable size and
ferocity disembowelling horses. However, my policeman seemed
to know all about crocodiles.
  `Should hear a bull croc when they're mating. Horrible sound.
He bellows all the time. It's not like an ordinary mating. The
bull bails up a few females in a creek and just rapes 'em.
Rough as buggery, they are. `Course, the female's just as bad.
They lay their eggs and then hang around for a long while and
God help anything that goes near that nest. Then they just
bugger off and leave 'em. The baby croc comes out of the shell
snapping and growling and hissing like a young dragon. Nasty 
brutes. Anyhow ...'
  He stood up and tossed his cigarette butt into the ashes of the 
campfire.
  `I suppose I'd better get along and see if I can find this one.
&quot;The body or the bloke,&quot; my boss said.'
  He came back again about mid-afternoon and because I felt that I
had got to know him well by then, I offered him a beer. He accepted
and rolled a cigarette, lit it, drank some of his beer and squatted 
on his haunch.
  `No luck?' I said.
  `Yes, well, sort of.'
  `Did you find him?'
  `Found his legs.'
  There seemed to be a sudden stillness in the pandanus clump as the
three laconic words emerged with shocking force. It took me several
moments to accept that this was reality and then all I managed to do 
was repeat his words.
