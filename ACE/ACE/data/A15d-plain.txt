Young get help on technology  

  A project aimed at helping young people cope with 
technological change was launched today at the Futures in 
Education Conference in Melbourne.
  The Commission for the Future and the Australian Bicentennial 
Authority have joined forces to develop an educational program to 
remove the mystery from science and technology.
  The resource kit will cover issues of widespread community 
concern - future of work, information technology, environment, biotechnology 
and the cultural effects of technological change.
  The conference, which has attracted leaders from the fields of 
education, business and trade unions from overseas and around 
Australia, will look at the contribution of education to economic 
recovery.
