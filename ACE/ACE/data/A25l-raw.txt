 The &quot;Mighty Mo&quot; - the USS Missouri - sailed into Sydney Harbor today
accompanied by hordes of vessels celebrating its arrival.
  As the 45,000 tonne warship sailed through the Heads and towards its
mooring place, smaller boats greatly outnumbering protest boats, hovered
around it.
  The Missouri reached the dock shortly after 8.30am amid little incident
from some anti-nuclear protesters who had gathered on the harbor to
demonstrate against its arrival.
  The ship is here for the Royal Australian Navy's 75th birthday celebrations
along with 40 other naval ships from seven countries.
  A spokesman on board the Missouri said:  &quot;It was a dream come true&quot; to
bring the historic warship Down Under.
  Four tugs met the Missouri at the Heads before accompanying her safely
to its mooring.  The port emergency tug led the warship up the harbor 
with all her fire hoses at work.
