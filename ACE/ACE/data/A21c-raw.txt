- Outed Canberra swimmer Jody McGibbon believes she and Queenslander
Brett Stocks were singled out by Australian swim officials for misbehavior
at the Edinburgh Commonwealth Games.
  McGibbon, 17, who faces a 12-month suspension for drinking alcohol at the
Games, said on Canberra's radio 2CA yesterday penalties meted out by Australian
Swimming Inc. were too harsh.
  The swimmers were told of their suspensions at the weekend.
  Stocks' two-year ban for his part in using a courtesy car from the Games
Village bars him from the '88 Seoul Olympics and could end his career.
  It is understood both can train but are ineligible for vital pre-Olympics
meets.  McGibbon said she was not aware of the full penalty for misbehavior
when she left for the Games.
 &quot;I signed a document saying that I wouldn't consume any alcohol, drugs
and so on and I did,&quot; she said.
  &quot;It has always been traditional that you all go out after and celebrate,
but this year it has just been changed.
  &quot;I had a few drinks after which was on the statement,&quot; she said.
  McGibbon will not know until October 1 if the ban will affect her
Australian Institute of Sport scholarship.
  An AIS spokeswoman said a review of McGibbon's position was likely.
