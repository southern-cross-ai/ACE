<h> Farmers drive a new coalition of businessmen against Hawke </h>

Nineteen eighty-seven, says DAVID BARNETT, will see the emergence of a dynamic
new political group of business interests - possibly a new party - taking
its lead from the New Right and not only threatening the Labor government
but also the Opposition parties.

BUSINESS organisations are cranking up to end the Hawke government in 1987-88
and none is more moti+vated and mobilised than the New Right's spearhead,
the National Farmers Feder+ation, whose leader, Ian McLachlan, has united
a broad spectrum of powerful industry groups.
  The fringe benefits tax, trade union superannuation, interest rates and
Labor's in+dustrial and fiscal policies are to be critically bombarded.
McLachlan has provided the impetus for the setting up of a whole range of
new political structures. Committees are being formed in the marginaL seats.
They say money has been raised and more is coming in. Nineteen eighty+seven
will be the year of the New Right. It may be Bob Hawke's last year as Prime
Minister. If it is not it could be the last year of the Liberal Party as
it now exists, and the same can be said for the National Party.
  If the coalition parties do not suc+ceed at the next elections, when they
are held some time between March 1987 and March 1988, the mood, the money
and the structures are there to pave the way for a new conservative party,
with pressure going on industry leaders such as Ian McLachlan and John Elliott
to enter political life.
  But on present indications it is high+ly unlikely to come to that. The
Bul+letin's Morgan Gallup Polls show that Hawke's budget session strategy
has failed. The government went into the budget session with the polls last
Au+gust showing support for the coalition at 50 percent and support for
Labor at 40 percent. By mid-November the gov+ernment had narrowed the
Opposi+tion's lead to 1 point. They were trailing 44-45.
  Hawke, the Treasurer, Paul Keating, and the ministry set out to discredit
Op+position Leader John Howard and his colleagues by means of personal attack,
with the aim of producing a gory Lib+eral Party upheaval, and a challenge
from Andrew Peacock, setting the scene for an election in March or April
next year based on the inability of the coalition to present a united front
and a coherent set of policies. For that strategy to succeed, Hawke needed
the level of government support to con+tinue its rise, overtaking Howard's
coa+lition during the end-of-year holidays, and it needed the Liberal Party 
to fall apart.
  The Liberals did not fall apart. In+stead, some unknown well-wisher sent
them a copy of a letter to Keating from the Taxation Commissioner about
his unfiled tax returns, striking a dramatic and devastating blow at Keating's
standing in the electorate.
  The day Hawke learnt that the Morgan Poll was showing a recovery in support
for the coalition to 48 points, and a fall in support for his government
back to 42 points, was the day McLach+lan as president of the National Farm+ers
Federation came to Canberra to see him. McLachlan's appoint+ment, originally
for 2.30pm, had to be put off for 3 1/2 hours because cabinet was still
wrestling with the problem of logging Jackey's Marsh. It had earlier dealt
with Rupert Murdoch's takeover offer for the Herald and Weekly Times, and
Keating's sub+mission for clearing his pro+posals for the double taxation of
company dividends, so they do not produce the host of unintended and adverse
consequences which have marked all the other propo+sals in the package of
busi+ness taxes.
  When McLachlan was shown into the cabinet room, he found Hawke shaking
with rage. Hawke berated him for having talked to the media on the way into
the meeting and for having made public his submission to the gov+ernment.
He refused to discuss the Farmers Federation's concerns and stalked out
after five minutes, leaving Keating to evict McLachlan, which he did with
an insult to McLachlan about seeking publicity instead of pursuing the
interests of farmers.
  McLachlan is a central figure in the New Right groundswell which is
trans+forming the business community. Un+der his leadership, the Farmers
feder+ation has so raised its profile that it ranks as a major political
institution, backed by $15 million raised by popu+lar subscription for a
fighting fund which gives it enormous financial sol+idity.
  The federation has devised a five-point strategy for 1987 designed to
ad+vance the economic and political inter+ests of the nation's 170,000 farmers
and their families. It has commissioned the former director of the Bureau
of Agri+cultural Economics, Andy Stoekel, to survey global markets for
Australian rural produce and recommend on where the efforts of the marketing
cor+porations should best be directed. It has decided in principle to
commission a lobbyist to watch out for Australian rural interests in
Washington, and it has commissioned a series of studies (which Stoekel will
also carry out) of the economies of countries which subsi+dise their rural
sectors heavily, such as Japan and the United States, along the lines of
an earlier study of the Euro+pean Community, to draw out the hid+den costs
to living standards of such subsidies.
  Apart from filling vacuums created by government inactivity, two aspects
of the Farmers Federation's strategy for the year are of direct political
relevance to the Hawke government. The feder+ation has $1 million a year
in interest from its fighting fund to back the pri+vate sector against the
trade unions in disputes such as Mudginberri, which is continuing because of
an appeal, and Dollar Sweets. About 40 percent of the fighting fund came
from secondary in+dustry, and the Farmers Federation, ac+cordingly, will
not confine its backing to the rural sector. It is also setting up committees
in the marginal seats to question candidates about their atti+tudes towards
economic and industrial issues.
  The federation sees the committee as long-term, and it is their intention
to in+fluence not only the result of elections through campaigning and
advertising, but also to be able to influence the pre+selection of candidates
for all parties.
  The Australian Small Business As+sociation, which is only three years
old, operates on the basis of a mass mem+bership, and so far has acquired
7000, of whom 2500 were enrolled between June and September, because of
con+cern about the fringe benefits tax. The association wants 20,000 members
by the end of 1987. It contributed $30,000 towards the Mudginberri fighting
fund, and lately has responded to union pick+et lines with its own counter
picketing, modelling itself on the United States National Federation of
Independent Businesses, which has 750,000 mem+bers, and the Canadian Federation
of Independent Businesses which has 55,000 members. Counter pickets were
used in the La Trobe Valley against in+timidation by the Building Workers
In+dustrial Union and in Deniliquin, against the Australian Meat Industries
Employees Union.
  They say that once they have suffici+ent members, they will just opt out
of the present industrial system, refusing to acknowledge the authority
of the federal and state tribunals and negoti+ating directly with employees.
  In the meantime, the Small Business Association is also setting up
organisa+tions in the marginal electorates to sup+port "pro-business"
candidates. 
  The Australian Tourism Industry Association has identified 14 areas which
it regards as vital to tourism and is developing a strategy for its ap+proach
to marginal seats. Many are also seats where tourism is economically
significant. The strategy is to concen+trate the level of interest rates
and in+dustrial issues, particularly penalty rates.
  The chairman of the Australian Fed+eration of Employers Andrew Hay is
endeavoring to achieve some co+ordination of activities through
21 af+filiated organisations, which include the Farmers Federation, Small
Busi+ness Association and the Tourism In+dustry Association, but at this
stage co+ordination is not a problem. They are all determinedly marching
in much the same direction, basically that outlined in the paper which
McLachlan gave Hawke, and which Hawke refused to discuss.
  McLachlan's submission argued that the government's budget strategy had
failed, and that it was no longer tol+erable, either for farmers or for
the business community, to operate with interest rates at 20 percent, as
they have been for the past 15 months. He wants Hawke to freeze wages for
at least one year and possibly for two and to drasti+cally wind back government
expendi+ture. McLachlan says that supporting the dollar by holding interests
rates up without controlling either wages or government spending is no longer
ten+able.
  Hawke's problem is that he already knows all that for himself but, for
party political reasons, won't do anything about it. Not only does he not
contem+plate a wages freeze, but he has stepped aside from the hard slog
of expenditure control. He has decided not to chair the Expenditure Review  
Committee which spends at least five months each year going through ministerial
expenditure bids.
  The decisions about how much money is spent each year on defence, education,
pensions, the environment and so on are formally made by the full cabinet
and announced in the budget, but the allocations do come from the Review
Committee, whose work is central to the conduct of government.
  Yet it is this process from which Hawke has withdrawn. Instead, he will
devote his energies to being a publicist, campaigning non-stop for the next
election with speeches, interviews, radio talk shows and public appear+ances.
Hawke is no longer trying to run the country. He is leaving that to his
colleagues. Instead he is trying to get his government re-elected.
  The polling which showed that the government's standing had slipped back
also showed that Keating and the fringe benefits tax are both electoral
lia+bilities. Keating's own standing has slumped since the controversy
about his private finances, while more people are against the fringe benefits
tax than are for it - 47 to 44 percent.
  The government's skilful advertising campaign has had some effect. Five
months ago the number disagreeing with the FBT was 5 percent higher. But
51 percent, up 7, believe the beneficiary should pay the tax, not the employer,
and 34 percent of Labor voters are against the tax, which has stirred up
strikes all the way from the Pilbara to the banks. The Morgan polls suggest
the tax is both a prime reason for the slide in the government's popularity
and an indication that the government is in an unwinnable position.
  Howard's strategy for 1986 was to discredit the government's economic
management, a task in which he could not easily fail. His strategy for 1987
is to convince the electorate that the com+paratively youthful and not
particular+ly well-known front-bench which he leads is a credible alternative
to the government, and that he has credible alternative policies.
  He has called a meeting of shadow ministers for the first week in February
to finalise a new batch of policies, more for the sake of appearances than
any+thing else. The crucial industrial policy, with its measured approach
to deregu+lation, is already announced and he is hanging on to his tax policy
until it is too late for the government to pre-empt its more palatable bits.
He also has to continue to isolate Peacock and his small band of supporters
and to live with the mysterious polls which appear from time to time,
commissioned by unknown persons, and which consist+ently rediscover that
he lacks charisma. Howard has decided that he can live with this.
  (The latest Morgan Gallup Poll - see page 29 - shows that Howard has failed
to make any impression on the electorate's view of the Liberal leader+ship.)
  Hawke and Keating were tempted by the November trade figures to spy the
first swallow in an economic summer, despite the question mark placed over
them by the Statistician. The deficit fell sharply to $635 million from
$1578 million in October, which itself had been revised downwards from a
record $1.7 billion.
  The figures were treated with scepti+cism by the media and with derision
by the Opposition.
  They showed that the deficit on mer+chandise trade, when smoothed and
seasonally adjusted through the Statis+tician's computer, was down to $140
million, and that there has been a pro+gressive improvement in this deficit
since June, when it was $368 million.

<h> Kakadu: paradise in peril </h>

<bl> By Alan Attwood </bl>

Can the federal government have its park and mine it, too?

  In shoes better suited to Parliament House corridors than dry stony scrub,
Barry Cohen was taking a close look at the Olgas, second-most popular
at+traction in Uluru National Park. The Min+ister for Arts, Heritage and
Environment was exploring his portfolio at the grassroots level and recording
the experience with a video camera. A station wagon sped by on the nearby
red dirt road to Ayers Rock, leaving billowing dust in its wake. "Perhaps
what we need here, Barry," said Professor Derrick Ovington, director of
the Austra+lian National Parks and Wildlife Service, "is a monorail."
  The look on Cohen's face was similar to the expression favored
by New South Wales Premier Barrie Unsworth when he hears the word byelection.
Cohen spent the next few minutes shaking his head in amazement. What next
- a lift to the top of Ayers Rock? Then it struck him that Ovington, an
eminently reasonable man who is on Uluru's board of management, was not
joking. Nor was Chip Morgan, the park superintendent and another reason+able
man. As a second car went by stirring up more red dust he noted how much
less mess a monorail might make. Cohen re+turned to his car with far more
to think about than sore feet.
  A monorail is not going to be built at Uluru; certainly not while Cohen
is min+ister, and probably never. No matter how many arguments are posited
about lack of dust or noise, cartoonists and conserva+tionists would pillory
anyone brave or foolish enough to authorize it. But even the possibility
of such a project being raised is indicative of increasing pressures on
the Uluru and Kakadu National Parks, both visited by Cohen recently. The
an+cient landscapes have fallen on modern times; the ruggedly beautiful
parks are being regarded less as wilderness areas and more as resources
for tourism, recreation and commercial ventures - all of which must be balanced
with Aboriginal interests in the land. Although a monorail can be dismissed
as a chimera, the question of mining cannot.
  The mere thought of mining in Uluru caused Cohen on his recent trip to
endorse a suggestion by Yami Lester, Aboriginal elder and chairman of the
Uluru board of management, that the park should be nominated for inclusion
on UNESCO's list of world heritage properties. This followed a submission
from the Northern Territory government on the proposed plan of management
for Uluru, in central Austra+lia, which suggested that the possibility of
exploration and mining in the park should not be precluded. In response,
Lester de+scribed the NT government as "a bunch of cowboys, interested only
in quick bucks," and Cohen privately expressed his opinion that certain
NT ministers would "mine the gold in their grandmothers' mouths if they
got a chance."
  Thus there was considerable piquancy in the news that Cohen had received a 
letter from Prime Minister Bob Hawke ex+pressing his concern that the proposed
plan of management for Kakadu, 200 km southeast of Darwin, did not make 
provi+sion for any future recovery of minerals. In two weeks Cohen had moved 
from the tranquillity of a bush trip into contro+versy, seemingly defending a 
besieged en+vironment not only from northern ma+rauders but also aggressors 
within his own camp. It may have made him appreciate the prescience of Justice
Russell Fox who, in his second report on the Ranger uran+ium project in
1977, said of the Kakadu area: "Possibly no other part of Australia is faced
with as many strong and concur+rent competing claims for the use of the
land as this region."
  At issue is the proposed stage three ex+tension of Kakadu, consisting
of about 6,000 sq km from the Gimbat and Good+parla pastoral leases. (Stage
one of Ka+kadu, including 6,144 sq km, was pro+claimed on April 5,1979.
In 1980 it became the first part of Australia to be included on the world
heritage list. Stage two, contain+ing 6,929 sq km in the north, was pro+claimed
on February 28, 1984.) At the opening of the present parliament, the government
announced its intention to extend the park. The proposed stage three would
take into the park virtually all the water catchments of the South Alligator
River system that feeds into Kakadu wet lowlands, rich with birdlife. In
his 1977 recommendations on the development of the region, Fox stated: "It
is desirable to in+clude at least one large total catchment in a regional
national park ... the South Alliga+tor River catchment is clearly the most
sui+table." The problem for Cohen and his ministerial colleagues is that
this same region is being regarded by mineral explo+ration companies as
a potentially rich source of gold and platinum. And while the proposed Kakadu
plan of management states that a main objective "is to protect the park's
resources from exploitation," it also acknowledges that mineral leases issued
before the declaration of the park should be respected. Such a lease is
that held by Coronation Hill joint venturers, with the major partners being
BHP and the Canadian-based mining company Noranda Australia. Located near
the South Alligator River, the mine would be in the park under Kakadu's
stage three extension. The ques+tion is: Can the government have its park
and mine it too?
  Barry Cohen describes as one of the few mystical experiences of his life
a heli+copter ride he once made over the Kakadu wetlands as thousands of
magpie geese rose as one from the water. But his first view of the Coronation
Hill site during his recent trip did not inspire rhapsody. From the helicopter
as it circled the scarred hill the prospect was of dry
olive-colored scrub and ochre abrasions. The uranium mine
that was worked on the site from 1955 to 1961 resisted encroachment by the 
sur+rounding bush: still visible are the disused shafts and tailing heaps.
Waiting to greet the minister were four men from BHP, led by Richard Carter,
the company's general manager for resource planning and devel+opment. Wearing
a peaked cap and sun+glasses against the midday glare, Carter made a
presentation replete with charts and figures about what had been done in
the way of mineral exploration. At the end of 1984 the old data from the
mine was reassessed; since then exploratory drilling in the area has been
carried out. What has been found are significant quantities of gold - an
average of five grams per tonne. There are also workable amounts of palla+dium
and platinum and BHP believes there are diamonds and silver.
  
  Carter showed a perspiring minister a map with an area of about 60 km by
20 km colored red and marked "Potential Exploration Area", al+though
he added that present exploration is being done in an area measuring only
400 m by 150 m. Asked by the Nat+ional Parks' Ovington why the joint vent+urers
were not interested in a less contro+versial area, given the environmental
sen+sitivity of the South Alligator region, Carter replied, "I would rather
dig in a place I know there is gold." This year the Coronation Hill joint
venturers will spend well over $A2 million on exploration and research.
They hope that by next year they will know if a mining operation is feasible,
and also that the future of the region has been decided by the govern+ment.
Not unnaturally, the miners would like some return for their investment,
but once again Cohen has reason to recall Fox, who wrote of difficulties
being ac+centuated "because companies were en+couraged to explore, and were
encou+raged in the belief that mining would be allowed, before environmental
consequ+ences were fully examined. Great care should therefore be taken
to ensure that no expectations are raised that further mining development will
be permitted." In a confidential submission to Cohen on the project the joint
venturerers wrote: "We believe the Coronation Hill deposit has less
environmental problems than many other mines in Australia." But Ovington
and conservationists doubt if any mining operations could be contained.
If there was any leakage of noxious materials into the river system feeding
into the park, damage to the ecosystem could be incalcu+lable. This is why
one proposal about the future of the Coronation Hill project - that it be
excised from any stage three extension of the park, just as the Ranger
uranium mine is inside the park but officially not part of it - makes more
aca+demic than practical sense.
  On the question of Coronation Hill specifically and, more generally,
explora+tion for minerals in the park - even if, as mining groups maintain,
it is just to ascer+tain what is there - Cohen faces such dis+parate opponents
as NT Chief Minister Steve Hatton, National Party Leader Ian Sinclair,
Resources and Energy Minister Gareth Evans and the Prime Minister him+self
who, while denying reports that the government was considering further ura+nium
mining in the park, does not want to preclude exploration for other minerals.
A semblance of unity was achieved on Sunday when Cohen and Evans co-issued a
statement discussing how "overwhelm+ingly important national economic
inter+ests" could be balanced with "one of the most beautiful and important
parts of our whole natural and cultural heritage"; but their portfolios -
Resources and Environ+ment - are uneasy bedfellows.
  Although mining has dominated recent discussion about the future of national
parks, in the long term, other issues such as booming tourism (increasing
at Uluru an+nually by about 10%; at Kakadu about 30%) and the delicate juggling
act involved in reconciling black and white claims on the land, will warrant
equal attention. The parks are old, but not indestructible. As cabinet met
this week off Sydney aboard HMAS Stalwart there were reports that Hawke
faced a backbench revolt on the qu+estion of mining in Kakadu. One matter
before cabinet was Kakadu stage three. It was hard not to feel that the
government's parks policy, like the cabinet itself, was all at sea.

  The anti-television Third World Prime minister saw no harm in giving a
few minutes of his time to two representatives of the local video company. But
when two white strangers entered his office with them the prime minister's
warning signals began to flash. He did not know who they were, and all four
had signed an appointment book under the one card. After 15 minutes the
irritated PM asked everyone to leave, but not before the stangers had been
asked to identify themselves. It turned out they were executives of an
Australian TV network lobbying for permission to introduce the upbeat bonanza
of its entertainment medium.
  The senior of the two was Lynton Taylor, executive vice-president of Kerry
Packer's Publishing and Broadcasting Ltd, operator of the Channel Nine Network
and the man who did most to bring the World Series Cricket "circus" into
being. The country where he was lobbying, in February this year, was Papua
New Guinea; the angry prime minister was Paias Wingti. Packer's PBL - which
now owns 50% of Media Niugini, the company whose local executives Wingti
had agreed to see - soon afterwards received a letter of protest against
the tactics used to beat a path to the prime minister's door. Such is TV
politics PNG-style. It has left a rival company controlled by Perth Millionaire
Kevin Parry high and dry with a $A10-million new TV station and a complete
ban on broadcasting.
  PBL already has the right to establish broadcast TV in Fiji. PNG is its
next frontier. But once again it faces opposition from Parry's Newcastle-based
NBN Ltd, whose PNG arm is the 87%-owned Niugini Television Network (NTN).
  Knocking over the Parry Corporation in PNG presents Packer with a much
tougher proposition. In fact, if there had not been a change of government
in PNG, chances are Parry's subsidiary would have been beaming TV around
the mount+ainous nation already. When Wingti ousted his former chief, Prime
Minister Michael Somare last November, NTN had already won approval from
the PNG government to be the first entrant to the nation's untapped broadcast
TV market.

<h> Kids on the local council </h>

<bl> By Elizabeth Adlam </bl>

<misc> In more than 50 towns and municipalities around Australia, young people
are being successfully initiated in community involvement and responsibility </misc>

  Proudly wearing his shining chain of office, Brett Chant, junior mayor
of Shepparton, Victoria, takes his seat on the raised dais in the town's
crowded council chambers, beneath the official photograph of a young Queen
Eliz+abeth. Beside him, the junior town clerk and junior city engineer look
down at the horseshoe-shaped con+ference table where 21 boys and girls ,
smartly dressed in their school uni+forms, sort through their papers a little
self-consciously. At the press desk at one side sits a reporter from the
local paper; from the opposite wall, portraits of the town's ex-mayors and
town clerks watch over the proceedings. As the doors close, everyone stands
for the opening prayer. The October 1985 meeting of the Shepparton Junior
Council has begun.
  A prosperous rural town in north+ern Victoria with 27,000 inhabi+tants,
46 per cent of them under 25, and 4500 between 10 and 20, Shep+parton is
typical of the more than 50 Australian local-government areas that have
established junior coun+cils. Its youthful councillors have launched a wide
range of programs over the years; thanks to them, the town now has a network
of Safety Houses, identified by letter-box stickers, where children being
har+assed or followed can seek help on the way to or from school, and a
maze will soon be built in a town park. Junior councillors have per+suaded
authorities to improve sev+eral dangerous town intersections and mounted
a campaign to reduce vandalism in local schools. Recently, moving into more
serious political areas, they proposed that Shep+parton be declared a
nuclear-free zone, and complained about the short notice given to ratepayers
when the town's water supply was fluoridated.
  Last year, on Shepparton's sugges+tion, more than 150 members from 10
of Victoria's 40 junior councils met at Altona for an inaugural state
conference. Discussion ranged from the need for drop-in centres for homeless
young people to the inad+equacy of public transport in country towns. "The
conference showed us that our problems were not unique," says Brett Chant,
"and we learned how other communities had dealt with them."
  The junior council was the brain+child of Alex Rigg, mayor of Shep+parton
fom 1965 to 1968. Rigg believed that such a council could give the town's
teenagers invaluable training in the realities of govern+ment and
administration, interest them in local affairs, and instil a sense of civic
pride. With the help of local schoolteachers, Rigg estab+lished the council
in 1968, and its success and community standing have grown ever since.
  Each February, Shepparton's high-school students and teachers choose a
junior council consisting of two Year-9 and two Year-10 students from each
of the town's six second+ary schools. The councillors then choose from among
themselves  a junior mayor, a junior town clerk and a junior city engineer.
Each school and its representatives are allocated one portfolio: public
ser+vices, finance and administration, health, community amenities, plan+ning
and development, or recreation and culture. Throughout the year, the school
and its representatives, supervised by a teacher, will be responsible for
all junior-council projects and proposals within the relevant portfolio.
  Going it alone. Being a junior coun+cillor has many benefits beyond the
obvious "perks" such as invitations to attend important functions and gala
occasions. Brett Chant claims that his term as junior mayor im+proved his
self-confidence greatly. "It is so good to have one's views taken seriously,"
he says. Juanita Grevill - a junior councillor in 1980 and now working as
a reporter with The Shepparton News - believes that the experience she gained
in public speaking and dealing with people has helped her journalistic career.
Adds town clerk Ivan Gilbert, "The junior council can also encourage young
people to make careers in local government - one of our for+mer junior
councillors is training to be a city engineer."
  Meetings are held monthly, follow+ing the exact meeting procedure of the
city council, with the junior mayor presiding. Two adult council members
attend each session to give advice or guidance. Junior-council coordinator
Joanne Church, 27, also attends. "I am there to help the kids," she says,
"but usually they choose to go it alone." Most junior-council mo+tions result
in one of the schools writing to a relevant body for infor+mation or action.
Most people are happy to cooperate, and indeed the junior council has won
so much re+spect that organisations such as the Freedom from Hunger Campaign
and the Foster Parents' Plan of Aus+tralia have approached it directly to
ensure publicity among school+children.
  Although most adults welcome what they consider to be reasonable proposals,
such as setting up a com+petition to design a sticker promot+ing the 1986
International Year of Peace, some say the young council+lors are too
idealistic. "They some+times leap up and demand action without first
considering the possible difficulties and how to overcome them," says Ivan
Gilbert.
  On the other hand, the junior council sometimes draws attention to a problem
that adults might never see, such as overcrowding on school buses. Gilbert
agrees that junior council "is an invaluable way of dis+covering what things
look like from young people's viewpoint."
  Shepparton's schools take turns to prepare junior-council agendas. "The
whole school gets involved," says Goulburn Valley Grammar School's coordinator
Beverley Manson. "Many students not on the council ask for the agenda, discuss
items and, afterwards, want to know what happened."
  Although all their council meet+ings are public, the young officials
soon forget the presence of adult councillors, coordinators and visi+tors,
and speak openly. "Sometimes they seem to be competing to see who can move
the most motions," says Wayne Johnston, Shepparton South Technical School's
coordinator. "But during their term as council+lors, they overcome their
enthusiasm to speak their piece at all costs, and learn to listen and think
before talking."
  Says Gilbert, "By working as jun+ior councillors, they learn to make properly
supported submissions and to recognise what course to follow to get action."
  They learn also to curb their youthful impatience. Says Brett Chant, "At
first, I got frustrated by delays in getting things done, but now I understand
the reasons. I've learned too that persistence gen+erally pays off!"
  At the meeting I attended, junior councillors debated a report, pre+sented
by Olivia Clarke of Goulburn Valley Grammar School, on the dangers of children
riding bicycles on footpaths. "Several people have been knocked down by
cyclists," she said. "It isn't fair."
  "Cyclists should stay on the roads, where they belong," agreed her schoolmate
Stuart Gowty.
  Andrew Mulcahy of Shepparton High School disagreed emphatically. "If cyclists
ride on the roads, then they are knocked down by motorists! It is much safer
if they ride on the footpaths."
  A fierce debate ensued on what penalties, if any, should be enforced for
riding on the pavement. Sugges+tions ranged from hefty fines to let+ting
down offenders' tyres.
  "Penalties aren't the answer," said Kim Crowley of Wanganui Park High.
"We need a public-education program to make motorists more aware of cyclists
on the road."
  At this point, the junior mayor showed his talent as chairman, taking
control just when things might have got out of hand. "Well, here we have
two points of view," he said, and neatly summed up both sides. At Brett
Chant's suggestion, the council agreed to invite a police officer to the
next meeting to give the official view.
  After the meeting had closed, I spoke to Shepparton's mayor, John Weir.
"Young people are full of ideas," he told me, "but they don't find it easy
to get them through to the older generation. Often, their views are casually
presented, in fragments, to parents over the tea-table or to teachers at
school. The junior coun+cil provides a unique forum where kids can think
their ideas through, express them effectively - and know they'll be listened
to. No community should be without one."

<h> A rainforest journey </h>

<bl> By Margaret Hotson </bl>

<misc> Evolving undisturbed for millions of years, Queensland's tropical wonderlands
are a trove of natural treasures worth protecting </misc>

  THE TROPICAL rainforest is a cathedral. Its trees form pillars that soar
into the sky. The leaves create a can+opy like stained-glass windows. The
ground is a tap+estry of a thousand shades of green, dim in most places
because the tree-tops block out the sun.
  Some 7800 square kilometres of such forest lie in scattered fragments
along Queensland's coast between Ingham and Cooktown. They contain some
of the oldest undisturbed eco+logical systems on earth - formed more than
100 million years ago, when the great reptiles ruled the globe. Over 50
national parks protect about one-seventh of this area, pro+viding unique
holiday camps for nature lovers. Last summer, I joined the growing number
of tourists who arrive here to bushwalk, birdwatch, spotlight for nocturnal
mammals, raft the rivers and swim in crystal pools beneath waterfalls.
  On the first evening of my visit, I went with two biologists, David Thomae
and his wife Kerstin, to spotlight possums in the Mount Hypipamee National
Park on the Atherton Table+land. More species of marsupials live in this
3.6-square-kilometre stand of rainforest than in any other area of comparable
size in the world.
  As the sun set, David identified the birds whose songs filled the clearing
where we sat. "Emerald dove ... eastern whipbird ... spotted catbird ...
Lewin's honeyeater ...." A large black brush turkey emerged from the forest
and stretched out its red head, yellow wattle dangling, to peer at us, then 
scurried off. "Grey-headed robin ... crimson ro+sella ..." David continued.
Queens+land's tropical rainforests, though covering just one-thousandth of
our land area, are home to almost one-fifth of our bird species.
  Darkness closed in. The birds fell silent and a chorus of crickets took
over to a background of frog mating-calls. Kerstin swept the spotlight over
the trees. "There's a green ringtail," she whispered. Gazing along the beam
of light, I saw two brilliant orange pinpoints - its eyes - and made out
the shadowy form of the possum's body. Then I saw the glint of a second
pair of eyes - the young on its mother's back. Both re+mained stock-still
while the light was on them, but disappeared behind the cover of branches
and leaves as soon as it was swung away. "The ani+mals don't seem to mind
the light," said Kerstin, "and by mesmerising them, it allows us to get
much closer than would be possible otherwise."
  Later, we spotted a coppery brush+tail possum, a dark brown and white
Herbert River ringtail and a pair of lemur-like  ringtails with rich
choc+olate-brown coats and fawn bellies. Our evening's climax, however,
was finding a baby green ringtail on a low branch by the road. It stared at
us balefully, clasping a half-eaten leaf, so close that I could count every
whisker on its delicate pink nose.
  My next expedition was to a water+fall hidden in the rainforest behind
the little sugar-producing town of Mossman. Local guide Sue Goadby led me
past pandanus and tall, para+sol-like fan palms into the heart of the forest.
After an hour's climb in extreme humidity, it was a relief to head down
a gully towards the water+fall. Across our path lay a fallen rain+forest
giant, its trunk covered in orchids, bird's nest ferns, staghorns and lichens.
Bright orange fungi already sprouted from its damp underside, beginning
to break down the dead plant and return its nutri+ents to the soil. Across
the gully, the snaking roots of a strangler fig spread their fatal embrace
round another liane-draped tree.
  We scrambled down to the water+fall, where shafts of bright sunlight pierced
the forest canopy. Around us, beautiful forest ferns grew thickly, and overhead
danced a blue Ulysses butterfly, 10 centimetres from wingtip to wingtip. Film
star Diane Cilento, who owns and pro+tects the land below this waterfall,
says, "People who view the forest from the roadside have no idea how full
of life it is."
  My next stop was at Cape Tribu+lation, in the Greater Daintree re+gion.
This area boasts one of the world's most remarkable concen+trations of
primitive angiosperms, or flowering plants.

<h> The rising tide of change: </h>

 <h> rethinking money and taxation issues </h>

<h> SEMINAR - 8-9 MARCH, 1986 </h>

  This weekend seminar, organised by the Association for Good Government,
will be held to discuss some of the many prob+lems of our times and the
possibility that both their arising and their solu+tion could be integrally
bound-up with one central adjustment: that of humanity to land.
  It is essential to become aware that alternatives to our present system
of taxation exists and that money and tax+ation influence all social matters.
That none of our present socio-economic-political systems has brought a
solution to these problems is without question. Also, that new ideas, new
and peaceful approaches to these problems are urgently needed, can hardly
be disputed. There+fore, it is fitting to bring such ideas to the fore in
the International Year of Peace, 1986.
  The proposition for analysis is that taxation should be based on structures
relating to land on which all life depends, and other taxes should be gradually
phased out - partially or tot+ally - as may apply. Land is the only commodity
which humans cannot produce. We cannot make more land to meet more demand.
This proposition is not a new brain wave, a clever scheme. It has been
advocated for generations. The origin can be found in the Old Testament.
Personalities like G.B.Shaw, Helen Keller, Leo Tolstoy, Woodrow Wilson,
Albert Einstein, Sun Yat Sen and many others, including Winston Churchill,
all have underwritten the morality and prac+ticality of the idea that land
values which are created by the community should be the source of public
revenue for the government, and not taxes on labour, thrift and industry,
as we have it today.
  Site value rating is in use by some two-thirds of Australian municipalities
and was first intoduced by Henry Parkes, a friend of Henry George, the modern
protagonist of this principle. That no political party of whichever persuasion
and of whichever geographical location has ever had the courage to follow
up this proposition to its full extent dem+onstrates only the lack of
understanding, the lack of morality of our society but nothing more.
  Re-thinking a new economic system, one which harmonises with human needs
of body, mind and soul is the issue. Once right thoughts are established,
right action will follow. At this seminar we do not want to concentrate
on the tech+nicalities of such a scheme. We want to make the effort to realise
that changes are necessary. We can not go on from boom to inflation, from
peace to war for ever. This cycle must be broken if our and future generations
are to live.
                                
<h> SPEAKERS </h>

  Speakers will include Deborah and Martin Banham, Stella Cornelius, Hal
Gingis, George Hardy, Penny Keable, George Parson, and Chris Whittle.
  Chairman will be Chris Veitch.

<h> IS DEMOCRACY POSSIBLE? </h>

<bl> Professor John Burnheim </bl>

<misc> Professor John Burnheim is from the Department of General Philosophy,
University of Sydney. </misc>

<h> The Problem of the State </h>

  Surely we have democracy! Not if it means that all citizens have an equal
chance of an active participation in public affairs. What we have is a
competition between organised political elites for the majority vote, which
gives them the right to govern. We elect professional power-brokers who
trade with each other their votes and patron+age. The results of the game
are determ+ined by concentrating power in organis+ations which are not
controlled directly by the people affected by their activi+ties - political
parties, commercial organisations, lobby groups of all sorts and so on.
These in turn attempt to manipulate public opinion and voting behaviour,
especially the relatively small group of `swinging voters' in mar+ginal
electorates. On the whole the power of the electorate is limited to refusing
to re-elect a government that offends these strategically placed bodies
of voters. It is a far better system than any of its actual competitors,
but it has very serious weaknesses. 
  The central problem is that it rests on an assumption that public life
must be organised in the form of States which exercise sovereignty over
every aspect of life in a given territory through their monopoly of legitimate
force. The system of States normally ensures a sort of peace and order within
each State, but at the cost of a perpetual tendency to war between States.
Internal peace is achieved at the price of a concentration of power that
breeds abuse of power. Rival groups strive to use State power to their own
ends, and in doing so constantly tend to increase the range of functions
of the State and the range of means at its disposal. Social life becomes
more and more standardised, bureaucratised and mystified. The tasks of
government become increasingly more difficult and as they fail in those
tasks governments are drawn into repression and war.
  Advocates of `small government' con+trast the efficiency and responsiveness
of the market with the inflexiblity, expense and stifling effects of
bureau+cracy. But the market, too, is far from democracy. If it enables
us to have a more flexible say in what we get as con+sumers, it gives most
of us very little opportunity as producers. Most of us simply sell to somebody
else the right to tell us what to do in our work. More+over, the market
cannot take account of things like the needs of future gener+ations, the
provision of public goods, or the righting of wrongs. One may argue endlessly
about its scope, but there must be a `public sector'.
  One of the crucial powers of the State is that of taxation. I believe,
in sympathy with Henry George, that public revenue should come from the
revenue from natural resources, though I envisage the way in which this would
best happen and its rationale somewhat differently. The power to tax should,
if possible, be eliminated.

<h> Functional Decentralisation </h>

  In the context of the State public goods of all sorts are provided by
centralised authorities at each level of government. Even at the local city,
mun+icipal or shire level a large range of functions, e.g. roads, parks
and recre+ation facilities, health clinics, libraries, building regulations,
waste collection and so on are provided by a centralised body, even though
there is no reason in terms of the functions them+selves for doing so. The
problems of libraries are quite different from those of garbage collection,
and each has more affinity with similar activities in other areas than with
each other. More+over, granted modern mobility and the diversity of people's
work and recreat+ional interests, the local community hardly exists. We
belong to many differ+ent specialised communities that overlap each other
in a host of differing and fluid patterns.
  The diverse activities that are joined together at municipal level
are united solely by the need for administrative and financial control.
Would it not be better to hand each over to a committee of people who had
an interest in that specific activity? That way we would ab+olish a level
of bureacracy, allow more flexible allocation of geographical boundaries
to various activities, and increase the opportunities of popular participation.
  The same principle can be applied at every level of government, right
up to international level. The idea of a world State is horrifying. But
there are already some international agencies that exercise considerable
authority in spec+ific areas without being dependent on any higher body.
The functions of States could be dispersed to a variety of in+dependent
bodies. Naturally, these would have to cooperate among themselves and recognise
appropriate regulatory and adjudicating bodies which would hear appeals
against them, adjust their constitutions in tune with changing circumstances
and needs, and resolve disputes between them. Insofar as these higher bodies
need co-ordination in turn, it would not be a matter of some higher power
forcing them to obey its injunct+ions but of a recognised arbitrating body
settling disputes brought before it. The sanction on bodies that refused
to accept arbitration would be the refusal of other bodies to cooperate with
them. Since each specialised body would need the cooperation of many other
bodies in many ways, the sanctions could be very powerful. There would be
no self-suffi+cient or sovereign bodies at any level.

<h> Democracy by Statistical Representation </h>

  Supposing that it is in fact possible to break up the bodies that provide
various public needs into specialised functional agencies of this sort,
how is it possible to control them democratic+ally? Elections would not
be satisfactory. Each of us has some interest in an enor+mous range of
activities, not because we are actively involved in them, but be+cause they
affect us in varying degrees. Because we cannot know much about the various
policies that might be pursued in all these areas, the candidates seek+ing
office or the practical problems of doing anything to change things, we
would not make an intelligent vote in most cases. Moreover, granted the
ex+treme unlikelihood of our vote making any difference to the outcome,
it would not be sensible to try. On the other hand, most of us could get
to know and under+stand quite a lot about a few of the activities that affect
us if we had any incentive to do the necessary work, if we had a substantial
chance of having a significant say in the matter.
  In the absence of such opportunities there is little we can do in most
cases except vote for a party ticket. At least a party endorsement tells
us something about a candidate. But that puts power back in the hands of
party machines, powerful lobbies and the professional image makers. Politics
becomes a career and careers depend on patronage. The power game takes over
at the expense of substantive issues.
  The alternative is that representatives be chosen not by voting, which
is a very poor way of conveying and aggregating information, but by a
statistical proced+ure that ensures that the representatives are representative
of those affected by the decisions they will have to make, weighted to take
account of the import+ance of the varying ways in which different groups
are affected. The representatives would need to display an interest in being
chosen by nominating for selection, and one would expect that in most areas
there would be a good chance of a candidate getting a turn on the relevant
committee sooner or later.
  So it would be worth their while to try to find out as much*muct as possible
about the activities in which they expressed an interest and follow the
proceedings of that committee. Moreover, one might expect that such committees
would be more responsive to suggestions and criticism than politicians or
bureaucrats as we know them.
  Members on each committee would be re+placed one by one at regular intervals
in order to ensure continuity. Political organisations might, of course,
urge their members to nominate for various committees in the hope of
influencing their decisions. But they would not have the power over their
members that part+ies now have, since there would be no place for endorsement,
advancement or patronage. It would be very difficult, too, for these committees
to become corrupt, since the membership would be constantly changing in
a random way, and those who had served on the committees would probably keep
a keen eye on their successors. If the committee veered too much in a certain
direction that would stimulate a rash of nominations from people of the
opposite tendency for the next round of sortition.
 
<h> Market Socialism </h>

  The higher level bodies which would  allocate resources, adjudicate disputes,
hear appeals and so on would be chosen by lot from a pool of people nominated
by their peers on lower level bodies as having the qualities necessary for
these more difficult tasks. There are obvious+ly many ways in which various
social systems might work using such a framework.
  My own preference would be for a `market socialism' in which each of the
major natural and accumulated resources would be entrusted to committees
of trustees who would lease them out to entrepreneurs, whether individual,
com+panies or cooperatives under conditions designed to protect the
environment, the public interest and the interests of posterity.

 <h> What's childbirth really like? Six women tell the truth </h>

The stories about giving birth are many and varied. No two experiences are
the same. Here, six women tell it as it really was.

<bl> By Tina Harris </bl>

<h> GAYNOR WHEATLEY, 28, TIM, 2, AND SAMANTHA,1 </h>

"How can I get this over fast?"
"When I was pregnant I went to class+es run by physios. You learnt to pant
politely and distract yourself when things got tough by counting dots on
the wall. They also wouldn't let you use the word pain. We would have
contractions, not pains. Well, I reckon whatever you call it, it still hurts.
If they could mix me a cocktail of pethidine*pethadine, panadol and gas, I'd 
take it in one hit and hope to pass out. With my first baby, Tim, I went to 
hospital where I was to be induced. The contractions began about an hour after
I was in+duced and I took everything they could give me. Glenn, my husband,
was there - probably wishing he wasn't - but it was great to have an
inter+mediary to plead for me. One nurse kept pushing my tummy really hard.
I said, `Please don't.' She just seemed not to hear me, so I said to Glenn,
`Tell her if she had a dreadful pain in her stomach, she would hate someone
doing this to her,' so Glenn said to the nurse, `I think you're annoying
her. Why don't you go and make yourself a cuppa?' She disappeared, thank
heaven. I know you're supposed to think how wonderful all this is, but I
could only think `How can I get this over with fast?' When Tim was born
and they put him on my tummy, that in+stant love thing didn't happen. He
was a stranger. I wished they'd take this in+credible goobie thing away
and clean it up and give me a cuppa. It wasn't till next day that I held
him and thought, `Wow! This little thing is mine.'
  "I'm having my third soon, so, in spite of what I'm saying about birth,
I think it's worthwhile in the end." (A few days after this interview Gaynor
gave birth to a daughter.)

If there is any such thing as the text-book birth, it is the one where the
first stage of labour begins with irregular contractions. You might just
feel tightening of the tummy muscles and a slightly uncomfortable sensation
in the stomach or back. This may go on for hours or days. Then the contractions
become stronger and more regular. When they are about 10 minutes apart,
you ring your doctor, probably go to hos+pital, and after some time enter
the second stage where you experi+ence an overwhelming urge to push with the 
contractions, give birth to the baby, then expel*expell the placenta. That's
what the book says!
  When the day comes though, there seems to be as many vari+ations on this
theme as there are women giving birth. Nearly everyone makes some deviation
from the pattern, ranging from trivial or funny to downright frightening.
Women are urged to think of giving birth as an exciting experience that
is both natural and beautiful, and while very few mothers would deny all
three adjectives aptly describe the event, most would have a few of their
own to add. Labour is an adven+ture that is probably more enjoyable in the
recounting than in the ex+perience. Like the best of adventures it presents,
along with the inter+esting and the unexpected, the routine, but it may
also have its alarm+ing moments. You experience anticipation, exhaustion,
determination, maybe even despair. Then progress, intense excitement, a
surge of power, triumph and peace. Peace and love of a magnitude you've
never imagined. You are in a zone all of your own.
  No one could honestly rave about the physical joys of labour and most
mothers manage to truly forget the level of discomfort, but the hours of
labour are more than balanced by the heights of emotional pleasure reached 
when you at last feel that new life wriggling in your arms instead of in your 
tummy. It is indescribably special to be cud+dling the world's most important 
baby. Cleo spoke to six women about their experiences leading up to that 
special moment.

<h> PEPPIE ANGLISS, 26, AND DAUGHTER KOBI,1 </h>

"I gave birth squatting in the water."
"I once saw a Russian film about giv+ing birth in the water and decided
that would be the thing for me. I was a swimming teacher and surfer and
have a great affinity with the water. I contin+ued to swim a lot when I
became preg+nant - two years after I saw the film.
  "The first sign that Kobi was coming was the water breaking one night.
I went to the doctor next morn+ing and he said if the contractions didn't
start soon I would have to go to hospital. I began pacing the floor and
saying to the baby, 'Please hurry up or we'll both finish up in a bright,
clanging hospital theatre'. I so much wanted the birth to be quiet and natural
and the pool was right there - in the next room at my doctor's birthing
centre.
  "Luckily, the contractions began and became strong very quickly. I felt
I had to get straight into the water even though it hadn't had time to warm
up properly. My teeth chattered to begin with but I felt relief from the
intensity of the pain immediately because I was relaxing beautifully with
the feeling of weightlessness. My husband, Rod, was with me all the time
in the pool. I gave birth squatting in the water. The midwife leant in and
we gently raised Kobi to the surface. I'd been in the pool two hours or
so and the water had heated to body temperature. It was beautifully
comfortable. Kobi was so relaxed. She just opened her eyes and looked at
us. We stayed in the pool another 40 minutes while she floated peacefully,
then Rod carried her from the water and the doctor helped me out. We lay
down, but I didn't sleep. I was too excited."

<h> LYA SHAKED, 32, AND SON EZRA, 18 MONTHS </h>

  "I wouldn't say it was painful."
"As a lay midwife I have worked with about 150 births myself. I know that
for me, home is the best place to have a baby. I prefer to be with people
who trust and support me - this doesn't always happen in hospitals.
  "When you give birth at home you would normally have a doctor, a regis+tered
midwife, possibly a childbirth educator and, of course, your hus+band. That's
what I had for my first two, but with the third, Ezra, things were very
quick. We would have had a doc+tor and midwife if it were necessary but
there were no surprises. Things went very smoothly - there were only three
hours between the first contractions that woke me around 4am and the birth.
When I began to feel twinges with the contractions I tried to wake Ian. He'd
had a very hard day and I couldn't stir him, so I woke my daugh+ter and
she sat with me as the contrac+tions got stronger.
  "My body was working very hard over the short period of time. The physical
build-up to the birth was very intense. I wouldn't say it was painful. When
the water burst Ian had woken up. Ezra came very quickly and we de+livered
him together. I was kneeling on the floor. After the birth I got the shiv+ers
and shakes. I think I was in mild shock because the birth had been so fast.
I knelt there holding the baby till I stopped shaking. Ian wrapped us both
in a blanket.
  "It was another hour before the pla+centa came. We gave Ezra a Le Boyer
bath and I had a wash. Then we all went back to bed and rested. You seem
to get the most wonderfully calming feeling after giving birth."

<h> ANNE STEPHEN, 26, AND SON RY, 10 WEEKS </h>

  "I felt pain but nothing I couldn't control."

"When I was about seven months pregnant with Ry I was support partner for
a girlfriend who gave birth with the aid of acupuncture. I could see it
was really helping with the pain. I decided then and there to have it, too,
to has+ten my labour and help me control the pain. Despite plans to have
my first child, Kim, at a birthing centre, things had gone wrong. I finished
up in theatre with spinal block injections, forceps, the works. I didn't
want that to happen again.
  "I went to hospital at 4pm one Sun+day - the contractions I'd been hav+ing
all day had become regular. When I got there, they stopped! I had one hour
of frustration and was getting quite emotional with the disappoint+ment
of it all, when the acupuncturist arrived to induce me.
  "I probably had about 12 needles in various parts of my body. There were
three in each foot and one in each hand between the thumb and first fin+ger.
Others were moved around - ears, knees ... You don't feel them.
  "After one hour I was having regular three-minute contractions. During
the contractions I felt pain, but nothing I couldn't control, and between
them I felt terrific. I was eating sandwiches and drinking orange juice.
It was won+derful to feel so alert.
  "When the second stage of labour started they removed the needles so I
could move about and give birth on my hands and knees. Ry was born only
three hours after the acapuncture had begun. It was all very exciting."

<h> WENDY SKELTON, 35, WITH TWINS DANIEL AND TIM, NEARLY 4 </h>

  "I think I began to panic... It was enormously confusing."
"I don't think I've ever actually recov+ered from the birth of the twins.
It was the most enormous shock because all through the pregnancy I had no
idea I was carrying two children.
  "The labour itself was very calm and uneventful - after about 11 to 13
hours of the normal build-up, Daniel was delivered. The doctor lay him on
my tummy and I remember thinking `What a small baby!'. He was small - only
two kilos. Then the doctor went white and looked shocked. He said, `Hold
on. I think there's another one there'. It was a wonder they hadn't heard
the two heartbeats before this. I was stunned. My first thought was very
selfish. After that beautiful release you experience after giving birth,
all I could think was, `Oh no! Surely I'm not going to start all over again'.
  "All of a sudden the room seemed to fill with more and more people. They
put me on a drip to help strengthen the contractions for the second birth.
I knew I had to try to keep my mind on pushing at the right time, but there
was a flurry of thoughts running through my head. How would our daughter
Rebecca cope with two babies in the family? I heard my husband, Russell,
sounding very excited because it was twins. I think I began to panic. Nine
minutes after Daniel was born, Tim ar+rived. After expecting one baby for
nine months I'd had nine minutes to get used to the idea of twins. It was
enormously confusing."

<h> JOANNA STEWART, 43, WITH CHRISTOPHER, 3 </h>

  "I became frightened something was wrong with the baby."
"When I was about four days overdue, tests showed Christopher wasn't get+ting

<h>"I'm PREGNANT ... and i don't know what to do" </h>

"It could never happen to me..." So many girls fool themselves like this.
The truth is, one in 20 teenage girls will fall pregnant. What if you're
faced with pregnancy? What are your options?

 <bl> By Daphne Sider </bl>

  Louise grew up living with her mother in a southern suburb of Sydney.
She fell pregnant at the age of 15 and was determined to keep her baby.
Now Ashley is a beautiful and happy three-year-old.
  "When I fell pregnant the first person I told was a good friend of mine
who was much older. She said I could move into her place because I was fighting
with my mother, and we discussed what I was going to do.

  "I was determined to keep my baby because I didn't feel abortion was right
for me. I was really happy about being pregnant. You see, before all this
I was really wild. I was always getting drunk and just out for a good time.
I felt a real fear of responsibility. But after I had Ashley, I realised that
someone else's life depended on me being stable.
  "Also , I wasn't getting on with Mum. I felt she had abandoned me and
I really wanted someone who needed me and loved me.
  "Now I've got to think of things like budgeting and I don't waste money
anymore. I feel heaps more mature than other girls my age, because Ashley
needs me to be.
  "I didn't set out to get pregnant. I didn't use contraceptives because
I never thought it would happen to me. I'd had sexual relationships before
and counted on my luck. Ashley's father and I hung out together for about
two months. He was Indian and never told his family about me because they
would have freaked if they knew he was seeing an Australian girl. He was
15 too. Ashley was conceived the very first time we slept together.
  "I don't see him anymore. It was best that we separated. Maybe when he's
older he'll be able to handle the situation better. I don't feel I need
his money or anything, but maybe Ashley will ask for his support one day.
  "Currently we're living on a Supporting Mother's Pension. It's hard to
exist on a little over a hundred dollars a week, but I'm lucky enough to
have other friends who help me out.
  "I like the thought that when I'm 30 Ashley will be 15. I'll have just
stopped doing the things that she's getting into and so I'll be able to
understand her and I hope she'll never have to lie to me. We'll be friends
leading a similar lifestyle."
  One in 20 teenage girls in Australia became pregnant in 1984. More recent
statistics aren't available yet, but it looks like the trend is continuing.
The majority of girls will opt for abortion, fewer will become single mothers
and fewer still will marry. The numbers that will have their babies adopted
are miniscule. 
  The reasons for this rate of pregnancy among young, unmarried girls are
varied, but naturally enough it begins with the level of sexual activity:
It's increasing, starting at an earlier age for both girls and guys.
  Studies have shown that the earlier you start having sex, the greater
the risk of becoming pregnant soon after. One-fifth of teenage pregnancies
start within a month of first having sex, and half will occur within six
months.
  More reasons why: Although there appears to be an increased knowledge
of contraception, their use is still relatively low. This could be due to
lack of access; unplanned sex; worries that parents might find them; a fear
that using contraception may indicate loose morals; the belief that "it
could never happen to me"; and basically, not considering the consequences
of unprotected sex.
  Also, some girls won't admit to themselves that they are involved in a
sexual relationship. For moral reasons they'd prefer to take a deliberate
risk, rather than a real precaution, as a way of reassuring themselves it's
a one-off situation. Even though it  may very well be a one-off affair,
the risks of pregnancy are too high to ignore. 
  For a teenage girl who feels unloved or unwanted, having a baby may be
seen as the answer. It needs looking after and is wholly dependent and will
provide love and, for some girls, a real purpose for living. Some also view
motherhood as a means of achieving self-worth or independence.
  Sue King, executive officer of Preterm, Sydney, says that alcohol is another
major cause of pregnancy among young girls. When they get drunk they often
forget themselves, and have sex without thinking or without really wanting
to. That's where the problems start.
  With free discussion of sex in magazines, books, films and amongst peers,
coupled with the option of contraceptives and their ready availability,
you may be sceptical about the relatively high incidence of teenage pregnancy.
The problem lies with the confusing attitudes towards the subject. It's
promoted by some, it's rejected by others ... just think of the messages
you're getting from the media, peers and parents.

<h> SINGLE MOTHERS </h>

  Like Louise, between 25 and 35 per cent of young, unmarried girls who
fall pregnant will decide to keep their babies. It's a hard decision to
make as it affects the rest of their lives and their relationships with
parents, friends and future loves. It's a decision which also affects their
social and economic prospects.
  Some of the real problems they face may include isolation and lack of
support; inadequate income coupled with fewer employment opportunities;
limited education; poor housing; inadequate medical care both during and
after the pregnancy; and fewer opportunities for free time from being a
parent.
  Louise stressed the value of having friends, particularly those older
and more experienced, who help with the baby's upbringing and with finance.
But not all teenagers are so lucky. Some risk alienation from their families,
boyfriends and friends.
  So what are her other options and how does she decide? Generally it will
depend on her age, her family, personal beliefs and values, her knowledge
and access to prenatal services, the length of the pregnancy before it's
confirmed, whether she sees a child as interrupting her future plans, and
whether she feels motherhood is a natural and inevitable conclusion for
her.
  These days options available to girls faced with an unplanned pregnancy
seem to be changing in emphasis. They will more than likely opt for abortion
or single parenthood rather than adoption or forced marriage.
  
<h> ABORTION </h>

  The majority of girls - between 35 and 50 per cent - will choose to end
their pregnancy by abortion. It's an extremely stressful and emotional decision
for any girl to make, but in Jenny's case she felt it was her only option.
  At the age of 18, Jenny suspected she was pregnant. This suspicion was
confirmed for her when she missed her period (which she'd never done before).
Jenny talked it over with her boyfriend. She'd been going out with him for
more than a year and, although there was no reason for it, she felt it was
a way of gaining more of his attention.
  At that time what frustrated Jenny was that she had to wait six weeks
after her missed period to have a pregnancy test done at the Family Planning
Clinic. She knew she'd choose to have an abortion. There was no way she
was about to give up her studies, her career plans, her independence. And
it seemed outrageous to her that her parents and boyfriend should suffer
for it, as she was sure they would.
  The test proved her suspicions. She wanted to cry but couldn't. She felt
sorry for herself, not for what she was going to do. And the same sentiment
carried her through the abortion and the days to follow.
  Jenny's boyfriend, Mark, was with her all the way. He accompanied her
to the clinic and offered moral support. Jenny's not quite sure what his
reaction would have been had she decided to keep the baby, but doesn't think
it's important now anyway.
  Prior to the abortion she was counselled. It was the first time she'd
been counselled about anything and she appreciated it, although she didn't
feel she really needed it. Other girls in the clinic that day were quite
hysterical. Jenny felt cold - a little religious remorse perhaps, but she
put that aside too.  
  It all happened in about ten minutes. That night she went home, cooked 
dinner for herself and her parents, and told them the movie she'd seen that 
day was interesting.
  It was a relief for Jenny that the problem faced by her unplanned pregnancy
was gone, and although sentimental when relating her experiences to me,
there was no remorse at all.
  But the ethical problems of remorse do affect many people. Those who believe
human life begins at the moment of conception will probably be outraged
at Jenny's apparent lack of concern for her child. Their vocal protests
are the reasons why many clinics must lock their doors, which can only open
after you've knocked.
  The physical risks of a young girl giving birth are reason enough for
some to choose abortion. Medical reports suggest that young girls, particularly
those under 16, have a greater chance of giving birth to a premature baby
and developing anaemia or high blood pressure in pregnancy, as well as
suffering many other complications.

<h> MARRIAGE </h>

  Marriage is an option, but a limited one. Teenage marriages have a poor
success rate - nearly half break up within five years. Adolescence is probably
the most unstable period of anyone's life; you change your attitudes, you
experiment in all types of ways. It's difficult to imagine that a decision
you make, particularly under duress, will be right for you in years to come.
Still, 15 to 25 per cent of pregnant teenagers will choose to marry by the
time their babies are born.  

<h> ADOPTION </h>

  The percentage of girls who put their babies up for adoption is very small
indeed. That's not so surprising, when you consider that they have carried
a child for some nine months.
 
<h> WHERE TO GO FOR HELP </h>

  It's been proven that the numbers of pregnant teenagers in countries where
contraception and advice are readily available are considerably lower than
those countries where it's not. Limiting the availability of family planning
courses results only in sex without protection.
  Teenagers are not too immature to use contraceptives effectively. The
problem is ignorance.
  There are many counselling services  you can ring or visit to ask for
pregnancy help or advice. Youthline is one of them; it's a young person's
version of Lifeline. Fifty per cent of all the calls they get deal with
pregnancy. Girls facing the prospect of an unplanned pregnancy, or those
pregnant girls who need information about their health and financial
situations, or who require accommodation, are usually the ones who call.
  The counsellors at Youthline are aged between 18 and 30; they are
well+trained to offer you all the options available but will not give
subjective advice. Youthline is a national counselling service and can be
contacted on the following numbers:

<h> BOYFRIENDS. to have or have not. </h>

Guys. You can't live with them, you can't live without them. Or can you?
Being single is not the end of the world. In fact, some girls even prefer
it.
  So, you want a boyfriend. Why? Because your best friend has one and you
feel left out? Because the formal's coming up? Because you're tired of kissing
mirrors? Or maybe you feel that deep down inside you need to share your
life with a special guy.
  Mmmmm. I guess that sounds reasonable enough on the surface. No matter
what guys are like, it seems we're desperate to put up with them. In fact,
we feel our hearts will break if we can't find a guy to break our hearts.
Funny, isn't it? Why is that the idea of being single unleashes all our
hidden fears of lonely spinsterhood?

<h> Intellectual failure </h>

Loss of competence is frequently but incorrectly attributed to getting old.
Very often, what we think to be decline in an old person's mental powers
is the result of emotional problems, such as depression or anxiety, or simply
disuse; young people kept in solitary confinement need re+training to regain
mental competence. Often we overcompensate for old people's mental decline:

  A colleague working at Harvard University began to suspect that, however
  well-meaning, the very act of helping old people may reduce their ability
  to look after themselves. The opportunities for practis+ing a necessary
  skill are removed, and the message that they are becoming incapable of
  self-care, producing a state called `learned helplessness', is subtly 
  conveyed.
    Three groups of old people were given jigsaw puzzles to test their
  performance. An examiner sat in on one group, encouraging , sug+gesting
  where to put pieces, and actively assisting in finding pieces to fit.
  In another, the examiner gave only minimal assistance and encouragement.
  In the third group there was no examiner, except for assessment before
  and after the experiment.
    The people who were helped performed less well than those who were only
  encouraged, while they did less well than those who were left to themselves.
  The `helped' group completed on the average fewer pieces, and worked more
  slowly.

This suggests that, although helpers mean well, they may be reducing the
competence of older people in their charge. It also shows that being helped
may make a task seem more difficult than it is and so reduce self-confidence.
  This does not mean, of course, that the many frail, aged people who require
assistance for their very survival should have it withdrawn! But we must
judge carefully when to interfere. The old idea that you were always losing
brain cells over the age of sixty seemed bad enough, but now we learn that
the big losses are when we are younger. In fact the present theory is that
we are born with brain cells in excess of normal requirements and are losing
a daily quantity from birth. The greatest loss is around the age of forty
when we begin to notice failing memory. However, from the start we have
learned to do without the ones that become discarded. Mental skills requiring
most flexibility are lost quite early - children and young teenagers take
to computers and solve the Rubik cube better than anyone. But our ability
to make judgments on the basis of information already acquired continues
to develop throughout life.
  We must therefore make certain whether or not an old person's men+tal
failure is intellectual, and this may require testing by someone specially
trained. We are all familiar with remarkable people who pre+serve their
mental powers and personality intact into the nineties. We are also painfully
aware that many become depressed and lose their mental acuity. For the majority
there is a falling off in certain mental abilities, particularly those tasks
that require a solution within a given time. There is a slowing of response
due to delay within the central ner+vous system, and so patience is needed
in communication, and instruc+tions are best given simply and briefly to
allow plenty of time for absorption. Old people find doing two things at
once difficult, so you may see an old lady stop walking while she puts on
her gloves. Then again you may notice old people moving their lips while
reading, and this is because they need to reinforce their understanding
by hearing the words as well as seeing them.
  Of course it is characteristic for the elderly to become less adaptable,
as we already discussed in Chapter 2, and this can make them difficult to live
with. Even more important, perhaps, it may be a serious barrier to successful
rehabilitation after an illness when new skills have to be learned. In this
chapter we describe the different ways your relative's mental processes may
be affected and how you may cope with these problems of the mind.

<h> Normal changes of aging </h>

<h> The emotions </h>
In old people, emotions assume an increasingly domi+nant role
and are liable to colour their beliefs about their lifestyle. There may
be a blunting of feeling leading to apathy or indifference, or an accentuation
of former characteristics so that someone, say, who used to be strict and
have demanding standards either mellows into tolerance or hardens into
despotism. It is well known that emotional activity in the elderly tends
towards certain patterns of behaviour - resistance to change, lack of
spontaneity, greater caution and distrust of the unfamiliar.

<h> Memory </h>
It is often said that when you are old you can remember the distant
past, but not what has just happened. This distinction, however, is not
by any means clear-cut. We have a short-term memory and a faculty for retaining
information, such as shopping lists, for a short time only, and then discarding
it when it is no longer needed. Certainly when someone's brain starts to
fail, short-term memory is more vulner+able, but this is really because of
an inability to register the information in the first place.
  We all begin to notice that our memory is not so good once we have passed
forty, and this type of forgetfulness is characterized by difficulty in
recalling names and events. Loss of recent memory - or indeed of any period
involving whole episodes, is a different type of failure and should be regarded
as a symptom of disease rather than a feature of aging. This may be due
to a number of conditions, both physical and mental (stroke or alcoholism,
or dementia, see page 94), and including the effect of drugs. So a good medical
opinion based on experienced assessment is needed.

<h> Memory aids  </h>
There are many practical ways you can suggest to help your 
relative remember necessary facts and domestic details. These will both provide
confidence and can act as a form of memory training:
  <misc>1. Keep a large daily diary with space to write all the day's activities,
     hour by hour </misc>
<misc>2. Use details in the environment - definite times, places, objects -
     to act as reminders to do a particular task. For example, put the coffee
     jar in a prominent place in the kitchen so that preparing a routine
     mid-morning snack is remembered </misc>
<misc>3. Reduce daily activities to those that are easily remembered by your
     relative </misc>
<misc>4. Encourage occupations that do not tax the memory too much, for example,
     painting or gardening </misc>
<misc>5. Praise, even reward good recall, but avoid putting your relative to
     the test. </misc>
Quite often elderly people lose their sense of identity, and need to be
reminded who they are, where they are and what time of day it is. Keep+ing
clocks and calendars, family pictures and mementos on hand so that your
relative can refer to them constantly helps strengthen self-confidence.
Make sure these aids are large, clearly marked and accurate. Reminiscence
can be used as a pleasurable form of mental stimulation. But when old people
begin to ramble, it is a good idea to change the subject to something more
concrete. Encourage your relative to make choices, and so retain his or
her independence.
  These suggestions are useful for everyone with a degree of memory failure.
They can also be helpful in stimulating elderly people with more severe
mental disability.

<h> Mental disorder </h>

The idea of mental failure  I want to say that whereas medical labels are
useful to the profession, I am not speaking only of dementia here. True
dementia is irreversible, but the brain may fail - that is, become confused
- for many other reasons, which are reversible. We have to think of mental 
failure rather in the same way as we do cardiac failure. This means that it 
can be compensated for and kept going with various forms of help, such as I
suggest above. The necessary adjustment can be made by reducing incoming
strains and providing a simple, familiar routine. Perhaps the most important
task for the doctor is to dis+tinguish the elements of dementia and confusion
from treatable de+pression, and this is not easy.

<h> Confusion </h>

Confusion can unfortunately give a false impression of dementia. But it
is simply a descriptive term indicating that someone has a disordered awareness
of his or her surroundings. Of course you can be confused more easily when
you are dementing - but anyone submitted to too many stimuli can be made
confused. Old people who cannot dis+criminate between sights and sounds
are predisposed, so that confusion is particularly common at dusk, when
it is difficult to pick things out from the background and stereoscopic
(simultaneous) vision is much reduced.                                 
  A state of confusion may be accompanied by delusions. Perhaps you have
felt confused for a moment on waking up in a strange hotel, or when suddenly
questioned while daydreaming? On a lazy holiday you may not be able to say
what day or time of day it is. So remember that anyone can become confused in
situations where too much or too little is happening, the surroundings are
unfamiliar and emotional drives are strong.
  In fact, if your relative is only confused, you can feel optimistic about
the outcome. In many cases confusion can be treated by removing the cause,
which may be one or a combination of the following:
 
<misc>&bullet; A full bladder </misc>
<misc>&bullet; Constipation </misc>
<misc>&bullet; The effect of drugs </misc>
<misc>&bullet; An infection </misc>
<misc>&bullet; Heart disease </misc>
<misc>&bullet; Minor stroke. </misc>

Looking after a confused person requires skilful handling. It is import+ant
not to thwart, but to learn how to guide and soothe your relative. If, for
instance, your old father has got up in the night with the idea of going
to work it is better to say, `Can I come along too?' and lead him into the
kitchen to sit down and wait for the bus, than to get into a noisy
confrontation. After a while he may take a glass of milk or a hot drink
and quietly return to bed, having forgotten where he was going in the first
instance. Let me say at once that this cannot always work, but it is the
approach most likely to succeed.

<h> Dementia </h>

Although it is so prevalent in old age - it has been estimated that about
one person in five over the age of eighty suffers from moderate or severe
dementia - it is not easy to detect at first. If you notice that your relative
has serious memory lapses, as I explained on page 92, or starts to behave
in unusual or obsessional ways, or has trouble with language, you should
speak to your doctor about it. Any of these may be due to anxiety or drug
effects, to confusion, or to brain damage, so skilled test+ing will be needed
to decide what is at the root.

<h> Coping with dementia  </h>
At least eight in ten elderly people with dementia
are cared for at home and they are also likely to be affected with other
mental and physical illness, imposing a severe strain on the relatives caring
for them. Depending on the degree of dementia, there will be repetition,
restlessness, mistaking people's identity - even yours - lack of motivation,
memory lapses, hitting out at supporters, and dis+turbances at night. Falls
and incontinence are caused by lack of physical control and the sufferer's
unawareness of his or her own body.
  I think it is true to say that the wish to care for someone with these
problems grows out of an established pattern of life, reinforced by bonds
of affection and obligation. But, of course, the personality change and
the accompanying problems mean you will feel sadness, and at times
exasperation, more acutely. When you care for someone in this condition,
one of the worst features is the inability to sustain a con+versation. It
seems as if the person is gradually becoming more and more remote, although
the physical resemblance is there.
  What should you look out for if you suspect your relative has dementia?
The following are typical symptoms; they can be alleviated provided you
are alert to them and take the measures suggested here and by your doctor
or geriatrician:

<h> How England's other half learns </h>

JOHN ARROW went back to his old school and the arcane world of Eton College
as 200 new tits (new boys) trooped in for the beginning of term.
Mud, glorious mud; the College (scholarship boys) play the Oppidans
(fee-payers) at the wall game - the ultimate example of sporting violence
and futility. Peculiar to Eton, the wall game requires the ball to be taken
from one end of the wall to the other. Years can pass without a single goal
being scored.

<h> Eton hides a secret behind the winding streets and elegant facades </h>

  I WENT BACK to my old house at Eton the other day. And it was full of
girls. In the room where my old mate Faulkner major used to sit surrounded
by cheesy foot+ball socks and dirty coffee cups, Joanna Haselden, a stunning
17-year-old blonde from Manchester, was chatting to her friend Alyson from
Solihull. Down the hall the festering aroma of teenage boys had vanished,
to be replaced by wafts of hairspray, soap and scent.
  It was enough to make an Old Etonian traditionalist fear for the future
of his old stamping ground. The opposite sex - whatever next?
  Well, pretty much the same as always, actually. The girls, it transpired,
were pupils of a summer school, run by Eton Col+lege during the holidays
to help state school pupils prepare for their Oxford and Cambridge exams.
However, life returned to normal with the beginning of the new academic
year in Sep+tember and doubtless it will be cheesy-sock time again. 
  For no matter how smart and self-assured the Etonians in these pictures
may appear to be, the truth is that their natural instincts are those of
Adrian Mole. The average Etonian al+ways walks around with his hands in
his pockets, polishes his shoes only when absolutely necessary (ie under
duress from a teacher or older boy), and has about 10 centimetres of ankle
showing below his pinstripe uniform trousers because he's growing like a
weed and his mother has no intention of spend+ing hundreds on a new suit
until the last one has had every possible moment of wear squeezed out of
it.
  The same young sprig of the upper classes lives, like every other boy
in the school, in his own room. It has a fold-down iron bed, a desk, a wardrobe
and an ottoman - the chest into which the average Etonian shoves his football
shorts, jock+straps, dirty magazines and anything else he wants to keep
away from the matron's gaze.
  Any Etonian knows that I have committed several terrible errors in the
preceding two paragraphs, There are no teachers at Eton. They are called
"beaks". Uniform is "school dress," a desk is a "burry" (short for bureau)
and the woman who looks after the welfare*wefare of the boys in any one
of the school's 25 houses would be shocked to be called a matron. She is
"dame," as in pantomimes, ugly sisters and the like.
  As you read this there are around 200 13-year-olds who are extremely nervous
about the fact that all these strange words are about to become part of
their vocabulary. They are this term's new boys.
  Once the head boys and cricketing heroes of their prep schools, they must now
adjust to life as the lowest of the low. Within the past decade Eton has
abandoned "fagging" - the system in which junior boys acted as the seniors'
servants - but the gulf between the "new tits" and their elders can still
be intimidatingly wide.
  All the more so when the new arrivals are confronted by their "colours
test," some two weeks after the term - sorry, the "half" (of which, naturally,
there are three in the Etonian year) - begins. The test examines every aspect
of the arcane trivia that the school so adores.
  The terrified new boy must learn all the colours of all the houses and
the 52 various sports teams that the school puts out, all of which dress
entirely differently from any of the oth+ers. And they have crazy names,
too. The under-16 cricket team is "Upper Sixpenny." The soccer First XI
is the "Association." Somewhere in the rowing hierarchy, which is based
on eights, there is an immensely important boy called "The Ninth Man In
The Monarch." I have no more idea of what he does now than I did when I took
the colours test some 15 years ago.
  Passing the colours test is like an induction into an ado+lescent
freemasonry. Once you can identify "The Keeper of the Field", once you can
find your way from "Agar's Plough" to the "Burning Bush", you've become
an insider. You know something the rest of the world does not. You can look
at the busloads of Japanese tourists and visiting journalists and feel the
heady sensation of everyone else's curiosity.
  To the average visiting foreigner, Eton is no more than an+other example
of the way the British continue to live out their past. The boys all wear
black tailcoats and stiff collars - gee, how quaint. And to the English
Eton means Super-Sloane chinless wonders with braying accents and the old
school ties. It means a place where standards are still maintained, or -
depending on the point of view - a disgusting symbol of an outdated and
oppressive class system.
  But Eton hides a secret behind the winding streets and el+egant facades
that make it look more like an ancient university than a school. A closer
look reveals brand-new laboratories; a 400-seat theatre; a new Olympic-standard
gymnasium and swimming-pool; a design and technology centre. These are the
jewels in the crown of a school that is determinedly, even ruthlessly, modern.
  Eton is a business that sells a very expensive product. It costs a basic
&pound;5,835 ($13,570) a year in fees, not including extras, uniforms and
the boys' incidental expenses. An Etonian par+ent is looking at around
&pound;15,000 of pre-tax income per boy per year at the school.
  Eton is competitive and success brings ample rewards of freedom and
privilege. It is hierarchical; senior boys organise the discipline of the
school by a number of bodies that are self-electing. If you want power for
yourself you have to get on with the people who have it now. This may not
be very nice, but it is realistic.
  This adaptability to the present, rather than any links with the past, makes
Eton what it is and gives its pupils an advan+tage that some may consider 
unfair. On the other hand, they pay a price that may be more than financial. 
There is very little physical bullying at Eton, but any weakness of personality
is seized upon instantly. Boys learn to cover up, to hide their feelings
or insecurities behind the confident, articulate, often arrogant facade
that characterises the average Etonian.
  Would you want that for your child? When I asked the sum+mer school girls
for their opinions of Eton, their feelings were mixed. Compared to regular
state schools the facilities were staggering. And they were struck by the
degree to which teachers expected them to take the initiative in class and
in+formal tutorial sessions.
  But there were drawbacks. Everyone agreed that the food could be truly
awful. Tales abounded of mouldy sausage rolls and over-ripe grapefruit.
Alyson Guiel looked around her small whitewashed room, covered in posters,
snapshots and mouldy bits of Blu-Tack left here by its usual male occupant
and said: "I had imagined huge, wood-panelled rooms, but each of the boys
pays &pound;6,000 a year and gets a room half the size of the one I have
at home."
  They had not met any of the boys, who had long since left for their summer
holidays. But they wondered how 17- and 18-year-olds could stand the rules
and restrictions of boarding-school life. They didn't think that it was
a good idea for them to be shut away from real people. And, as Joanna Haseldon
added: "There should be girls here. The boys must be sex-starved."
  Now there she may well be right. And it is probably also true that the
presence of girls at Eton would make the boys pleas+anter, cleaner, more
considerate and much more understand+ing of the opposite sex. What it would
do to the girls, however, doesn't bear thinking about.

<h> ETONIANS </h>

THERE are about 1,250 boys at Eton. Each boy's parents pay &pound;1,945
a term in fees, plus extras. Each boy must have at*a least two schoolsuits,
consisting of pinstripe trousers, tail coat and waistcoat, at around
&pound;150 each. He will also need hundreds of pounds' worth of shirts,
ties, games clothes, casual clothes, towels, curtains and so on.
  There have been 20 Etonian prime ministers, including Wellington, Gladstone
and Macmillan. Current Etonian pol+iticians include Cabinet members Lord
Hailsham, Nicholas Ridley and Paul Channon; Tory "Wets" Francis Pym, Ian
Gil+mour and Lord Carrington and Labour MP Tam Dalyell.
  Etonian writers include the poets Shelley, Gray and Swin+burne. In the
20th century 1984, Brave New World and James Bond are all creations of Etonian
authors in George Orwell, Aldous*ous Huxley and Ian Fleming (Bond himself
was not an Eton+ian). Novelist Anthony Powell, art historian Harold Acton,
critic Cyril Connolly, economist J M Keynes and philosopher A J Ayer all
attended the school.
  The Old Etonians won the FA Cup in 1879 and 1882 and were runners-up four
times. In 1967 the Eton rowing eight were the world junior champions, beating
the Russian and East German national teams.

<bl> By Phil Jarratt </bl>

  IF YOU'RE a baby boomer with a long memory, you may recall Haight-Ashbury,
Dr Timothy Leary, Indian headbands, fringed frontier jackets and The Summer
of Love. It is almost 20 years since Sergeant Pepper told the band to play
- beginning a bizarre cultural revolution of sorts that had a profound effect
on the way we looked at drugs, the environ+ment, even the war in Vietnam.
  The hippie movement had many homes, from Amsterdam to Istanbul, from
Greenwich Village to Glebe. but nowhere was the beads and bangles brigade
so evident, so pervasive, as in San Francisco.
  "If you're going to San Francisco, be sure to wear some flowers in your
hair," went the song. And they did, filling the seedy streets of the Haight
with the spirit of free love and cheap thrills. But San Francisco got sick
of the hippies even before the rest of the world did and so they moved on,
generally finding rural retreats where their unorthodox behaviour was rendered
acceptable by sheer force of numbers.
  In the way of human evolution, hippies became New Settlers who became
disaffected subsistence farmers who drifted back into the cities and became
fully-fledged yuppies. Except in northern California, where the spirit of
Jefferson Airplane lived on long after the band had become a Starship and
succumbed to commercial temptation. And in one northern Californian town the 
spirit lives on, albeit a little wheezily, today.
  In 1971, two oil tankers collided off Bolinas - an hour north of San
Francisco, in ritzy Marin County - leaving the area's beautiful beaches
fouled with slick. Environmentally concerned young people from the Haight,
the houseboats of Sausalito and the Berkeley university campus descended
on the tiny village to help clean up. Many of them decided to stay and the
hippies controlled the town of 1,500 people by the mid-1970s through stacking
the boards of such instrumentalities as the Bolinas Community Public Utilities.
This board managed to halt any new housing construction by barring the
distribution of water meters.
  But even more noticeable than the anti-building stance was the new attitude
to tourism.
  The picturesque, if slightly shabby, village had been a tea-and-scones
stop on the way to Point Reyes National Seashore Park but the flower children
ripped the sign down.
  Even though the California Transport Department has erected 34 replacement 
signs, the road to Bolinas remains unmarked.
  When I first visited Bolinas, a decade ago, I was immediately seduced
by the potent mixture of liberal thought and creativity.

<h> Putting dollars into housing </h>

<bl> Tony Dalton looks at alternative finance for public housing </bl>

  ADVOCATES OF AN EXPANDED and high quality public housing system have been
experiencing a finance crisis for some time. More recently the number of
people having problems with housing finance has grown: many prospective
owner-occupiers have not been able to get the finance they need at a price
they can afford. But instead of working towards fundamental changes in housing
finance, which could go some way towards ensuring a steadier supply of finance
to both owner-occupied and a public housing, the government has again reacted
with in+creased subsidies to home buyers.
  The prospects for public housing sector are not good. The Minister for
Housing and Construction continues to fight for federal budget funds for
public housing, but now he openly states that future increases will be modest.
Certainly the ALP's policy commitment to double in ten years public housing's
share of the total housing stock will not be met. There is also the possibility
that the amount that the state governments will allocate from their low
interest rate Loan Council borrowings to housing will be limited in the
future. Finally it is not generally appreciated that the increasing rebate bill
faced by the state housing authorities will have an increasingly profound
effect on the amount available for additional public housing. Something
like $250 million of untied grant money now goes in de facto social security
payments to low income public tenants unable to meet the cost rent.
  The prospects of owner ocupied housing are also not good. There are
indications of a very considerable down turn in the production of new dwellings
over the next few years. In 1984-85 the total number of dwellings completed
was 152,700; it is expected that this level of activity will decrease*decrase
by approximately ten per cent per year over the next two years. By 1986-87
the number of completions will be about 125,000. This will be well below
the demand for new housing forecast by bodies such as the Indicative Planning
Council for the Housing Industry.
  The reason for this downturn in the private sector is the reduced
availability of finance, a result of market interest rates increasing to
very high levels. With the savings banks and the building societies still
regulated to charge a lower than market interest rate on housing loans,
they have had trouble attracting deposits, causing a diminishing supply
of funds being available for lending.
  Unlike the shortage of funds for public housing, this situation is creating
a sharp response in a number of quarters. The odds are that this will produce
some form of action at Federal government level and perhaps in the finance
sector. As it now stands banks, building societies, housing industry employer
bodies and trade unions have been making submissions to government, and
it is rumoured that a number of cabinet submissions have sought to identify
options for increasing the level of finance available for housing loans.
  It is difficult to predict the outcome of this process. It is likely that
the interest rate ceiling will stay for the present because of the political
dangers of increasing the cost of funds for existing owner-occupiers. Every
effort will be made not to increase the level of the first home owners'
scheme because of the government's determination to restrict expenditure.
A likely interim step will be to secure more funds for housing loans through
overseas borrowing by the banks supported by the government.
  Whatever happens it is almost certain that the changes will be interim
ones. Eventually the Federal government will deregulate housing finance,
removing the ceiling on rates. This is likely to be done when interest
rates come down to somewhere near the present ceiling. The only question
that remains is that of accompanying measures. The government will have
to ensure, if it is to be re-elected, that levels of investment in housing
are maintained. This will undoub+tedly be done in consultation with the
private building industry. Advocates of public housing must ensure that
they are a part of this process of consultation. It is just possible that
in the design of these measures the non-profit housing can get one or a
number of its proposals up. 
  IN OPPOSITION THE LABOR PARTY SAW the long term solution to housing finance
fluctuations as extension of regulation. It planned to require all financial
institutions to contribute to a National Housing Fund, in effect, an extension
of asset controls over the non-bank finance sector. Not surprisingly this
proposal was opposed by the deregulatory Martin Committee, and won little
support in the Hawke Labor government.
  A second proposal that may have a greater chance of success in the continuing
deregulatory climate is the introduction of capital indexed bonds. They
are a variation on the more traditional bond issues which are already a
feature of government borrowing programs. Capital indexed bonds are more
suitable to a period of inflation and uncertainty: lenders who buy the bonds
are guaranteed a return of, say, two or three per cent over the inflation
rate; because there is certainty over the long term rate of return, investors
do not seek the higher interest rates that may be available in other parts
of the market. Ultimately the borrower pays a lower real rate of interest on
the loan.
  Housing bonds represent a possible mechanism for investment in housing
in both the private and non-profit housing sectors. Indeed, the Victorian
government has already made an issue of housing bonds. It has used the finance
raised in this way for `on-lending' to owner-occupiers under a Ministry
of Housing home purchase assistance program.
  At this stage capital indexed bonds have not been used to finance non-profit
housing. However, it remains as a possible mechanism which, if developed
and refined, could sustain flows of finance into the non-profit sector.
These flows could also come much nearer to satisfying the demand for capital
than is presently the case with the budget allocations of the Federal and
State governments under the Commonwealth State Housing Agreement.
  If this method of financing the public sector was adopted there would
need to be changes in the way public housing is subsidised through a reduced
interest rate and an annual grant. The grant is a relatively recent
development. This subsidy then gets passed on to tenants as lower rents
through a system of rebates.
  A better approach is to move towards a situation where the full interest
rate is built into the costing of public housing, in order that public housing
operates in the same financial condition as the private sector, and does
not perform the income security role of the Department of Social Security.
Accom+panying this move there would then have to be changes to the income
maintenance system. Preferably this change to income maintenance would result
in the income levels of all statutory income beneficiaries being raised
in a way that recognises the contribution that housing costs make to poverty.
However, a more limited program and perhaps more feasible in the present
economic context would be to have the social security system meet the rent
rebate bill incurred by state housing authorities and the other providers
of public housing.
 
  THE OPPORTUNITY FOR considering these issues on a regular basis is now
provided for in the Commonwealth State Housing Agreement. As renegotiated
in 1984 it states that "the operation of the Agreement is to be evaluated
trienially". It would not be stretching this provision too far to advance
the argument that the financial provisions of the agreement are inadequate.
The triennial evaluation should consider how the financial provisions could
be improved. In particular there should be investigation and develop+ment
of the use of capital indexed bonds for investment in both the public sector
and owner-occupied housing.
  In the current context investment in housing is falling sharply. Arrangements
established in the 1920s and 1940s are not appropriate to a deregulated finance
market and high interest rates. An initiative is required which will facilitate
continued investment in housing in a way that ensures better access to housing
finance across a range of income groups.

<misc> Two recent government decisions raise questions about Australia's policy </misc>

<h> A migration smokescreen  </h>

<bl> Renata Singer </bl>

  THERE ARE SO MANY LARGE AND difficult issues facing this country at the
present time, it is puzzling that the Federal government is investing time
and funds in running a campaign on the relatively insignificant problem
of illegal immigration. For a campaign is certainly being waged. A ministerial
statement on illegal immigrants in October 1985 announced, unheralded and
undebated, tough new measures against those not legally in Australia.  
  Readers of newspaper reports on this issue in recent months might imagine
that Australia has a serious problem. The Department of Immigration and
Ethnic Affairs (DIEA) quotes a figure of 50,000 people living in Australia
without legal authority.
  Where does the figure come from? The department itself concedes that it
is an estimate, not calculated on the basis of numbers of arrivals and
departures, visas issued or other substantive data.
  Roughly the same figure has been used in the past whenever the department
has focussed on the issue of illegal migration. Before the amnesty of 1977
the claim was that at least 40,000*40,00 people were in Australia illegally. But
only 7207 came forward and applied for amnesty. At the time the Regularisation
of Status Program in 1980, it was claimed there were 60,000-70,000 illegals.
When the amnesty ended in December of that year, about 11,000 applications
had been made representing approximately 14,000 people. In 1982 the department
announced a `crackdown' on illegal immigrants, and this time it claimed
100,000 as the likely figure. Since then, without any campaign, 50,000 illegal
immigrants must have disappeared of their own accord!
  Who then are the prohibited non-citizens? No one can say with any certainty
who they are, or why they came and stayed in Australia, but some data is
available for those who apply for, and are granted, change of status to
become permanent residents. Prior to October 1985 anyone could apply to
change their status who had strong and compassionate grounds, whether they
had current `legal' status or not. Since October 1985, only those who are
considered `legal' in Australia can apply, no matter how strong, humane
or compassionate their case might be.
  In 1984-85 9898 people applied to change their status. Of the 6014 granted
residence status, 69 per cent of approvals were for spouses, children and
aged parents of Australian residents and citizens. They were eligible to
stay under the family reunion aspect of our immigration program. In many
cases they tired of waiting for the departmental process, which can take
years. In some cases a disaster had occurred which made it imperative for
them to leave immediately, or they were given incorrect advice by friends,
relatives or immigration officials.
  MRS Z IS JUST SUCH A CASE. Born in Spain in 1925, she married at 18, and
conceived 18 children of whom eight sur+vived. Five of these children,
themselves married, are now resident in Australia, the first having migrated
twenty years ago. Mrs Z's husband died in 1965.
  Of her three daughters married and living in Spain two live far away from
the city where she had lived her whole life, and the third could not
accommodate her mother in already cramped housing.
  The well-established and flourishing part of the family applied under
family reunion for their mother to join them in Australia. After the usual
delays of many months, permission was refused because Mrs Z was deemed by
the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs not to be a 'dependent parent'
as she was not yet 60 and had other children living in Spain who could support
her.
  In 1985 the daughter who lived near Mrs Z, and to whom she was most attached
and dependent on, received permission to migrate to Australia and Mrs Z
came with her.

<h> Gentlemen versus players in union struggle </h>

<bl> By Tony Abbott </bl>

TEACHER unionism in private schools is celebrating its coming of age with
an old-style bunfight between dif+ferent factions of the New South Wales
Independent Teachers' Association.(ITA).
  Elections last November produced a lurch to the left and the narrow defeat
of president Peter Ofner. Now Ofner and his supporters are seeking to over+turn
the result, claiming that ITA offi+cials used union resources to sway the
poll.
  Shenanigans of this sort are as old as unionism, but this is the first
time the sordid reality of power politics has penetrated the politically
virgin ITA. Unionism came late to private school teachers, whose dedication
long resem+bled that of the religious brothers and nuns whose places they
largely filled. However, in the past 10 years union membership has increased
from around 10 percent to nearly 80 percent of New South Wales' private
school teachers. Increased militancy, at least among union officials, has
wrung great+ly improved conditions from school authorities.
  At the same time, the union's grow+ing power and influence has attracted
the sort of ambitious activist who has long flourished in the state school
teacher unions. Ofner predicts that serious industrial relations problems
will pose a threat to the future of private schools.
  Ofner's involvement with the ITA began in 1977 when it was a fledgling
lobby more concerned with getting or+ganised than pressurising schools.
Ofner blames the constitution for many of his problems.
  The then general-secretary*general-secratary, Zyg Gardon, wanted to avoid
the factional+ism and political in-fighting which, he believed, marred most
unions. Conse+quently, under the ITA constitution, candidates for election
to the union executive had first to be approved by local branches. Gardon
said the aim was to keep out cranks and zealots.
  Instead, it has meant that the union establishment is almost impossible
to challenge because many of the branch+es are under the influence of the
estab+lishment. Moreover, because the elected representatives are full-time
teachers and only part-time union offi+cials, the union has come to be
domin+ated by slicker and more professional full-time officials who are
appointed by the executive rather than elected by members.
  It is a quirk of Australian industrial law that state-registered trade
unions, such as the ITA, are able to concentrate power in officials who
never have to face a membership ballot.
  Ofner says that his uneasiness with policy developments crystallised after
general-secretary Michael Raper and two other full-time officials saw him
late in 1984 to warn him about views he was expressing to other executive
mem+bers. 
  He says that he then became con+scious that Raper's full-time position
and access to information gave him the upper hand in dealings with elected
but part-time officials.
  Simmering conflict between the amateurs and professionals burst into the
open at a council meeting last June when Ofner alleged that Raper had aligned
the union with the left-wing steering committee of the New South Wales ALP.
  At the August council meeting no+tice was given of a no-confidence motion
to be moved against Ofner. At the September meeting, Ofner, as pres+ident,
ruled the motion out of order on the basis of a legal opinion which he read
to the council. However, the coun+cil overruled him and dismissed him.
  Ofner saw his sacking as evidence of the left's ability to manipulate
the union structure. He successfully ap+pealed to the New South Wales
Indus+trial Commission for reinstatement on the ground that he had been
denied nat+ural justice.
  But this was not before Raper had written to all members, saying that
Ofner had been sacked for making serious allegations against the union which
he could not substantiate. It was this letter which Ofner claims unfairly
influenced the result of last November's poll. In the meantime, progressive
can+didates were claiming that Ofner's cam+paign was backed by the National
Civic Council, a conservative union lobby. Ofner says that his claim is
absurd, since he had been heavily criticised by the NCC in 1984, but that
the charge damaged his credibility as a politically non-aligned candidate.
  So far, Ofner's attempts to have the result overturned have been bogged
down in argument over the Industrial Commission's jurisdiction. Another
option open to him is a claim in the Su+preme Court that the election involved
a breach of the common law rule that union resources should not be used
in election campaigns.
  But Ofner's room for legal man+oeuvre is limited by the expense of
liti+gation. A spokesman for the ITA, which has already spent more than
$29,000 on legal fees, said he hoped that Ofner and his friends "haven't
had to put second mortgages on their homes in this climate of high interest
rates".
  Ofner is aware of the risks he is run+ning but says he considers that
the battle for justice in the union and for the preservation of viable private
schools is worth the sacrifice.

<h> Education </h>

<h> Schoolchildren fodder in a feminist war </h>

<bl> By Geoffrey Partington </bl>

FEW CLAIMS are heard more often about Australian education than that it
systematically disadvantages girls and women. People paid high salaries
for running school systems shout the bad news from the rooftops, although
they never offer to resign. John Steinle, for example, Director-General
of Educa+tion in South Australia recently wrote in a booklet distributed
by the tens of thousands: "The department recog+nises that particular groups
are disad+vantaged by our present education sys+tem. The largest of these
groups is girls." But the cry of unfair discrimina+tion is most often bruited
from the ser+ried ranks of women's advisers, equal opportunity officers
and various other shes who must be obeyed. How true are their accusations?
  Even the more ardent feminists do not claim that there is overt
discrimina+tion against girls in schools. Boys and girls are subject to
the same attendance laws and the amount of money spent on schooling is little
affected, if at all, by gender. On the whole, being more do+cile and sociable,
girls take to school more readily than boys, are quicker to master skills
prized in schools - being in particular notably neater and better co-ordinated
on average - and gain higher average levels of achievement in primary schools.
Most primary teach+ers, especially in the junior grades, are women so that
suitable "role models", to use the trendy phrase, are more abundant for
girls than for boys.
  Curricula have not been highly dif+ferentiated by gender in the past,
but until very recently feminists latched on to every form of differentiation
as evi+dence of unfair discrimination against girls. The biggest feminist
hate until as recently as 1980 was single-sex schools because, as English
feminist Madeleine Arnot put it, "the dominant form of re+production of
bourgeois gender rela+tions (until recently when it has been modified) has
been that of single-sex schools" and "the use of single-sex schooling has
been the major form of reproduction of gender relations - re+lations that
constituted the bourgeois ideal of the family form of male hier+archy and
female dependency and sub+ordination". Bourgeois ideals are, of course, known
by fem+inists (nearly all highly bour+geois themselves), to be very wicked
indeed.
  For nearly 20 years Aus+tralian governments have been following feminist
ad+vice to abolish single-sex schools and to make the cur+riculum of boys
and girls identical in mixed schools. In high schools there was an as+sault
on woodwork and metalwork for boys as against cookery and needlework for
girls; in the junior primary schools, boys were encouraged to play more
in the Wendy House and girls to engage in more boisterous pursuits (no pretend
guns though, please). Child-centred feminist teach+ers found their underwear
in a constant twist because they believed with one part of their minds in
letting children follow their own interests, but with the other they felt
it necessary to prevent children, also victims of our disgusting bourgeois
society, from choosing "traditionally sex-related" interests.
  On the playing fields the cry is still for identity of treatment. Federal
Edu+cation Minister Susan Ryan, the Com+monwealth Schools Commission's
Commissar for Girls, Eileen Duhs, and an army of female jocks continue to
de+mand uniformity in sport. In South Australia in 1986 Equal Opportunities
Commissar Josephine Tiddy has suc+ceeded in producing an outstanding feminist
blueprint for equality: school+girls must be permitted to participate in
traditionally boys-only sports, but boys will be banned from messing up
tradi+tionally girls-only sports. Sex differ+ences in sport, so many feminists
be+lieve, are merely "socially-constructed" and not based on real, objective
differ+ences in average height, weight, speed or aggressiveness.
  Just as victory seemed nigh in the feminist fight against single-sex schools
and against sex-based differentiations in mixed schools, along came Dale 
Spender and a new wave of feminists. Spender is a luminary in the London 
University Institute of Education, but she and her equally militant sister 
Lynn, still in Australia, are female scions of the famous Spender family of 
which Sir Percy was merely one of the most prominent in the Australian upper 
crust. Dale Spender's great contri+bution to the gender debate is the claim 
that in mixed class+rooms teachers, women just as much as men, unfairly 
dis+criminate against girls by con+centrating more on the boys. In so far as 
this claim is really true, it relates only to the tendency for boys to 
misbe+have more than girls and for teachers therefore to spend more time on 
correcting and censuring the boys. This does not seem to be evidence for 
unfair discrimination, but Spender's disciples repeat the claim with 
enthusiasm. Judith Whyte, a science educator, writes that "boys initiate more 
contacts with teachers, are more successful in gaining teacher time and 
attention and are perceived by teachers to be more rewarding and reponsible 
pupils". Whyte fears, too, that "the possibilities for equalising male and 
female participation are very limited". Another science educator, Jan Hard+ing, 
told South Australian feminist teachers last month that giving more time and 
attention in mixed classes to girls is no good either, because "what often 
happens is that teachers instinc+tively go and help girls in science and 
technology classes and in doing so often confirm their helplessness".
  Feminists often try to have it both ways. Until the late 1970s a larger
pro+portion of boys than of girls stayed on at school after the age of 15.
Feminists cited that as evidence of "unequal par+ticipation of girls in
education". In re+cent years a larger proportion of girls than boys have
stayed on at school after 15. Feminists hold this proves "the un+equal
participation of girls in the work force". Similarly feminists allege unfair
discrimination because girls, if given the choice, opt for mathematics and
physical sciences less frequently than do boys but, despite lip service to
bi+lingualism, no feminist claims that the smaller proportion of boys choosing
a foreign language to an advanced level shows unfair discrimination against
them. Heads the feminists win, tails they sure don't lose.
  It is strange that feminists, despite frequent rhetoric about the uniqueness
or even the superiority of women's in+sights, invariably regard patterns
of choice by women as worse than those made by men. Traditional areas of
women's work are automatically deni+grated by feminists yet they claim
that non-traditional areas in which women come to predominate, as with medicine
in the Soviet Union, are only conceded because they are trivial and
unimport+ant. As Marx (Groucho) put it: "If it's a club that will let me
join it, it's not worth joining". It's what the American anti-feminist Midge
Decter calls the "shit-work" thesis: whatever women do in larger numbers
than men is defined by feminists as low in worth.
  For Australian politicians the im+mediate problem is that, after reducing
and well nigh abolishing single-sex education in every government school
system in the commonwealth in re+sponse to feminist demands, they must now
go back over the course and separ+ate the boys from the girls again, at
the behest of new feminist demands. For feminists the problem is that bourgeois
ideals are generated both by single-sex and by co-educational schools. The
Partington 1986 Award, of too hand+some a value, will be presented to the
feminist theoretician who finds a third way, so that we can both avoid having
the girls together with the boys, or sep+arate from them.

<h> Chapter 3 </h>

<h> The School </h>

The school was a wooden building - less primitive than my boarding place,
but nonetheless a very basic structure. I was rather shattered to discover
that I had thirty-six child+ren on the roll; this was very large for a
one-teacher school. They ranged in age from five to fifteen years, and from
Kindergarten to Second Year High School. There was definitely not seating
accommodation for thirty-six pupils in the classroom and so, in fine weather,
Kindergarten children sat on mats on the verandah. This made teaching
extremely difficult, for discipline was a problem.
  The previous teacher had left me no information about the ability of any
of the children, and she obviously had not given the High School Entrance
Examination, with the result that I didn't even know if any children were
entitled to commence High School work that year.
  On my first morning, I decided to try and gain some idea of the standard
of work of the children to enable me to place them in classes. Arriving
at school early, I put graded sums on the blackboard. After our formal
introduction, greetings and a friendly chat, I said, "I want you to start
on the sums on the board and go as far as you can." Immediately a hefty
lad, aged about fifteen, stood up and yelled, "We don't do sums at this
time in the morning!" I explained that I was the one who decided what subjects
they did, and when. "Today," I announced firmly, "it is arithmetic - right
now." There followed a most unpleasant argument, but it was one I had to
win, and eventually I was at my wit's end. What form of punishment could
I employ? This great lout was taller than I and seemingly quite fearless.
Grabbing the cane, which I had seen in the drawer, I advanced threatingly
towards him. This fortunately had the desired effect. I don't know who was
the most startled - the boy or the other pupils - but I do know who was
the most scared. Had I known what I learnt a few days later, I would have
been even more frigh+tened. The previous year, this same boy used to grab
the teacher, bundle her outside, barricade the door, and then the pupils
had a merry time.
  Luckily for me, my bluff worked and we did the subjects I chose. However,
as time progressed, discipline became almost impossible. The two ringleaders
were utterly in+corrigible. They were past the legal school leaving age
and had absolutely no desire to learn, but by coming to school avoided working
at home on the farm. It would have helped considerably had I been able to
discuss the possibility of expelling them, with my Headmaster friend or
the Inspector, but how could this be done on a party line? Finally it became
too much for me and I did expel them. I wrote to the Inspec+tor, telling
him of my action. He wrote back, saying the step I had taken was a very
drastic one and he would visit me as soon as possible. I called on both
sets of parents. One family was extremely rude, but the other informed me
that their son had been expelled from a number of boarding schools, including
one in Sydney, so it was no wonder I had problems with him.
  But now the trouble really began. The school settled down to work, but
every day the two expelled pupils pulled up outside on horseback, screaming
obscenities. Of course, once again, had I been more experienced, I would
have written to the policeman in the nearest town.
  There were no panes of glass in the windows, and no locks on any cupboards
or drawers. I decided to remedy this. My landlord agreed to purchase the
necessary requirements in town for me and then lend me the appropriate tools.
Any hope that he would offer to assist me was dashed, when he presented
me with the tools and proceeded to explain their usage. The following Saturday
I spent the whole day at school, in an effort to make it secure. The picture
of my putting in panes of glass, using the handle of a spoon to get the
putty in smoothly, must have been an amusing sight. Finally I went home
well satisfied. Imagine my dismay, when I arrived at school on Monday morning,
to see all panes of glass piled up on the top step and all the locks beside
them. There was no doubt this was the work of my two tormentors.
  The weather was extremely*extemely hot in February and as there wasn't a 
single tree in the school playground I decided to try and procure some to 
plant. These were available in the nearest town and Wally collected them for 
me; so another Saturday was spent planting trees. Alas, these shared the same
fate as the panes of glass. It was disheartening to say the least.
  Things quietened down for a week or two. However, I was concerned by the
fact that many pupils came to school quite late and absenteeism was rife.
As pupils never brought notes to explain this, I decided to visit the parents
and find out the reasons. Some of the children lived miles from school and
rode in each day. (We had a small yard for the horses.) How was I to reach
these farms? The crossbred draught horse seemed to be the only answer -
not the most comfortable horse to ride, but he got me there. The parents
mostly resented my coming. They said the children were needed to help with
the milking, because they couldn't afford to pay for labour. There was very
little I could do except appeal to them.
  By this time the weather had cooled down slightly, and as the school looked
so bare and unkempt I suggested to the children that we grow some plants.
Perhaps if they did the gardening, the two terrors may not destroy their
labours, but alas, that was wishful thinking. The pupils were excited and
worked enthusiastically, digging and planting, but on Monday we arrived
at school to find all the plants dead on the doorstep. The situation was
becoming quite desperate.
 The following week brought an even more disturbing incident. Walking across
the paddocks one morning, I was confronted by several girl pupils screaming
hysterically. A large black red-bellied snake was coiled up on the seat
of the girls' lavatory. Whatever was I to do? As a city girl, I was terrified
of snakes and the very thought of trying to kill one - especially shut up
with it in a confined space - appalled me. One glimpse of the reptile was
enough to convince me that I should wait until one of the older boys came
to school. There was one particularly nice lad, who was anxious to learn
and who helped me wherever possible. Arming himself with a suitable weapon,
he went off to kill the offender, but arrived back a few minutes later,
laughing uproariously - the snake was already dead! To me it was no laughing
matter and I could not help wondering what would happen next.
  About this time the rainy season set in, and within a few days the river
came down and the creek flooded - making crossing over the log impossible.
For a few days I rode to school on the `all-purpose' horse, but then the
current became too strong too for that. Nothing daunted, I decided to swim
across, with my clothes in a waterproof pack strapped to my shoulders. As
the creek was well out of sight of any farmhouse, I was able to dress on
the other side. Swimming a flooded creek is no pleasant experience, as a
great collection of rubbish is swept down and had to be dodged, so I was
very pleased on the Friday, when the water level began to drop and the log
became visible. By the following Monday it would be possible to try crossing
that way again. Normally, because I was unable to lock up the school building
or anything in it, I had to carry all school records back and forth with
me each day. I wasn't prepared to risk anything that first morning - I'd
be lucky to get myself safely across. With no handrail, and only a long
stick with which to balance myself, crossing the log at any time was hazardous.
  As the water level was still quite high, I was feeling some+what apprehensive
about the crossing, and when I reached the creek I stood for a few moments,
plucking up courage to start. Suddenly I realised someone was calling me.
Turning, I saw the father of one of my pupils beckoning to me from behind
a clump of bushes. Completely perplexed, and some+what alarmed by this unusual
behaviour, I decided reluc+tantly to go over and confront him. The man was
very embarrassed, but finally explained, "I've often thought the tricks
those two boys played on you were quite funny, but I don't think what they 
have done this morning is funny. Actually, it could be very dangerous." He 
then informed me that a thin wire had been attached around the centre of the 
log, with the idea that it would trip me and I'd be thrown into the swirling 
water. "So I've come to warn you," con+tinued my would-be-rescuer, "but for 
God's sake don't ever tell anyone who told you." Thanking him gratefully, I 
promised to keep quiet as to why I had changed plans and returned home.
  For me, undoubtedly, this was the climax and I was not prepared to tolerate
further trouble. I sat down immediately and wrote to the Inspector, telling
him that I could not remain at that school any longer, unless something
were done to improve the situation. I also stated that I was not prepared
to return to school until my landlord had cleared the log, and the flood
waters were lower and less frightening. At the same time I wrote and reported
the incident to the policeman in the town twenty miles away.
  The following week, the Priest arrived from town to conduct Mass at one
of the farmhouses, with the result that all the pupils, except my landlord's
two children, stayed away from school to attend Mass.
  The school was on the main road, but the only motor vehicles to ever
pass by belonged to the butcher and the baker, who called once a week. I
was therefore amazed to hear a car coming up the road that morning , as
it wasn't the day for either tradesman. I was simply horrified when the
car pulled up at the school and a very portly gentleman climbed through
the fence. (We had no gate.) He reached the door, introduced himself as
the School Inspector and then looked in astonishment at the empty classroom.
"The children are all at Mass," I hastened to explain. "The teacher isn't
at Mass?" he queried. I informed him that I was not a Catholic and even*ever
if I were, I would be at school on a school day. Really, it was fortunate
the children were absent because it enabled me to relate to him the whole
story from the day I'd arrived. He was most upset about the refusal of the
locals to board me and said he would certainly tell the Priest the story.
My action in expelling the two troublemakers fortunately re+ceived his support.
He explained that for the past two or three years the school had been going
through a difficult period, but little did he realise just how difficult
that period had been. What I knew - and he didn't - was that the previous
teacher frequently went to town with the butcher on Thurs+day afternoon
and returned with the baker at lunchtime on Monday. None of the locals ever
reported her, as they were only too glad to have their children at home
to help on the farm.

<h> Australlian outdoor education course </h>

<h> A unique survey of leadership and instruction qualifications, </h>

 <bl> by Sandra Bardwell </bl>

&bullet; AN IMPORTANT FEATURE OF THE RAPID growth of the Australian recreation
and leisure industry during recent years has been the proliferation of related
courses at universities and colleges. These are intended to equip students
to gain employment in the industry by qualifying them, among other things,
to lead and/or instruct groups in outdoor recreation activities.
  There is no single source of information about courses likely to interest
Wild readers - those with practical rather than theoretical orientation,
for doers rather than planners. This survey aims to fill the gap. It also
draws attention to the sometimes vexed question of the value of
certification, such as provided by the Bushwalking and Mountaincraft
Leadership courses. As their content shows, such certificates signify that
skills have been tested fairly thoroughly, and that awareness of the potential
hazards and problems (especially those to do with human relations) has been
instilled. Participants are left in no doubt that there is more to leading
a trip into the wild than just bashing about in the bush and trusting that
everything will be all right.
  This national survey covers full-time courses at tertiary institutions
and shorter, non-institutional, non-profit-making courses, in which training
in outdoor recreation activities, and in the skills of leadership and/or
instruction, is offered as the major component of the course. The activities
concerned are bush+walking, ski touring and canoeing; no such courses in
caving and rockclimbing have been discovered, although both activities might
be covered in one of the tertiary courses listed. Students in these courses
are required, to varying degrees, to do these activities and to acquire
a reasonable level of skill, as well as to study theoretical subjects.
  Thus the survey does not cover the many courses which, by their titles,
may seem to meet these criteria. These include leisure studies, recreation
courses focusing on sport or activities such as dancing and drama, studies
in recreation planning and pro+gramming, and park management, and natural
resources or `facility' management.
  In Victoria, at least, some technical schools offer outdoor recreation
subjects at HSC level - no attempt has been made to identify them in this
survey. It is worth noting here that the Outdoor Guides Course at Katoomba
Technical College, mentioned in Wild Information, no 20, will be offered
as a part-time course in 1987; inquiries should be directed to the Course
Co+ordinator, Jim Smith, Katoomba Technical College, Parke Street, Katoomba,
NSW 2780; telephone (047) 82 1099.
  All the information in this survey is derived from the literature published
by the institutions and organizations concerned, and from further inquiries
- very few, if any, of the brochures contain all the information an intending
student may need to know. Many of them are overloaded with almost meaningless
waffle about the courses - skill in reading between the lines is handy.
  No specific dates have been given for terms or semesters for the tertiary
courses. Most of the institutions covered operate two semesters during the
year, the first beginning late in February or early in March.
  The crucial dates are those on which applications for enrolment close.
For tertiary institutions, applications for acceptance into a course are
made through a separate State authority - a Universities Admissions Centre,
or equivalent. The university or college subsequently handles enrolments.
  No information about the costs of the tertiary courses has been given.
Normal union (or equivalent) fees are generally levied; wide variations
in the requirements for books and equipment make any attempt to estimate
costs meaningless.
  Because of the practical nature of the courses concerned, they are generally
not available to external students. People wishing to apply for acceptance
into a course conducted in a State different from that in which they completed
secondary education should check acceptance of their qualifications before
lodging a formal application.
  Status is an elusive but important factor. The Australian Council on Tertiary
Awards (an official body) administers, by independent panels, the accreditation
of all courses in advanced education in Australia, a procedure which takes
place, for each course, every five years. Accreditation is on an academic
basis, but appropriateness or demand is taken into account. The procedure
is also designed to ensure reasonable consistency between the courses offered
in each State. Federal Government funding is only given to accredited courses.
Thus it is unlikely that a course will be offered which will not be accredited.
  Apart from this, an assessment can be made by finding out whether a course
is a prerequisite for or part of teacher or other professional training,
and by the number of years it has been in existence. Almost any training
at a reputable institution will enhance, but not guarantee, chances of gaining
employment in a chosen field. Ultimately, however, the value or success of
a course depends on the quality and ability of individual graduates.
  Similarly, short courses may be judged by the number of years they have
been in existence - they would not have continued if demand was not sustained.
It is also worth checking whether a course is required or preferred by
government agencies for undertaking specific activities, especially with
school groups.
  For short courses, do not neglect finding out whether you need to arrange
insurance or whether you will be covered while on the course, and if so,
to what extent. This vital subject is not mentioned in much detail in the
available literature.
  It is noteworthy that canoeing, in particular, is highly organized and
standardized, and that there is strong emphasis on acquisition of skills
and on leadership training in bushwalking, a trend gathering momentum for
ski touring. Such formal training and organization for rock+climbing is
apparently absent. Although leadership skills are less relevant to this
activity, technical skills and measures of ability, especially in teaching,
are important. Thus, Mountaincraft Pty Ltd believes that a `most
unsatisfactory' situation exists concerning climbing instructors. One
`accreditation' system is based on the fairly low level of climbing ability
of the person who runs it. Mountaincraft is trying to devise a standard
for instruction, but believes that `maturity and instructional ability are
more important than climbing skill' - which applies equally to instruction
in the other rucksack sports. Among the courses offered by Mountaincraft
are Abseil Instructors (five days, technical and climbing skills, written
and practical examinations) and Advanced Rock+climbing (full week, `to achieve
an instructor level for which there is no agreed civil standards in this
country'). Address: PO Box 582, Camberwell, Victoria 3124; telephone (03)
817 4802.
  Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, two questions should be answered:
`What type of career do you want to follow?', and `Which course will best
lead you towards this?'-

&bullet; MITTAGUNDI, ABORIGINAL FOR `campsite next to the Mitta', is located near
the old gold-mining township of Glen Valley, on the upper Mitta Mitta River,
in north-east Victoria. Lying just east of the Bogong High Plains, and
surrounded by the mountains of the Great Dividing Range, it is a remote
and beautiful place.
  The camp, on a 200 hectare property, is simple and old-fashioned, designed
to be built, maintained and operated by the young people who come to it.
It is a place where people matter, where co-operation is stressed, and
competition played down. It represents the realization of a dream for its
founder, Ian Stapleton.
  Ian worked with Outward Bound before spending seven years as the Director
of Outdoor Education at Timbertop, the `bush arm' of one of Australia's
most prestigious schools, Geelong Grammar.
  It was during this time that Ian came to believe that all young people
should have the opportunity to experience our mountain country, its challenges
and rewards, not just those lucky enough to go to schools that could provide
such opportunities.
  He had always been a great believer of the levelling quality of the bush
- the way it can bring together all sorts of people from all walks of life 
and situations, on an equal footing, and demand co-operation from everyone.
  Initially, Mittagundi operated from temporary bases. Because of the many
problems, mostly financial, it frequently looked like it would founder before
it was properly started. However, it is now firmly established on a permanent
site and is able to run nine-day courses all year round.
  The camp is spacious, and set in a clearing of about two hectares. Old
renovated Melbourne Tramways buses are used for bunk-rooms, stores and an
office. Gradually these are being replaced by permanent mud-brick and timber
buildings built by the people on courses, using local materials and traditional
methods.
  The buses, although somewhat out of place in such surroundings, played
an essential part in the establishment of Mittagundi. In order to get the
camp started, and as cheaply as possible, Ian bought a fleet of old buses
from the Tramways Board. The one catch was that he had to remove the engines
and transmissions from them, so that he could afford what was left. With
a wry smile he admits that was a mistake. It would have been much easier
if he had left the engines alone. Ian laughs now when he tells the story
of how it took him 18 months to tow all the buses to Omeo with his old worn-out
Land Rover. It involved him in countless `unfortunate incidents', took over
40 Land Rover clutches, and brought him into conflict with seemingly every
government department!
  The camp now boasts several permanent buildings - store-rooms, stable
with fenced yard, equipment shed, even a `bush shower'. (Let your imagination
run wild here!) The building programme is now centred on a new kitchen/dining
room. The ground has been levelled, the stump holes dug, and the enthusiasm
for the project rising. Partially funded by a grant from the Menzies
Foundation, the new building will have a huge stone fireplace - to be built by
a stonemason - timber floor, and various other luxuries. The temporary
kitchen/dining room, which is open-sided, with a dirt floor and a leaky
roof, will then be demolished, although not without some regrets, I suspect.
  Wood-fired boilers, of considerable age, provide hot water, massive old
wood stoves are used for cooking, and lighting is by gas and kerosene. Needless
to say, collecting and cutting wood is an important part of everyday life
at Mittagundi.
  All the courses at Mittagundi take roughly the same form, varying slightly
according to the season, weather and people attending. The maximum age for
participants is 18, and the courses are not co-educational.
  Each group, of about 20 people, hike into Mittagundi over two days. Watches,
radios and money are not allowed into Mittagundi, and are left in a safety
deposit box before the start of the hike. The route, over the Bogong High
Plains, is an old miners' bridle-track. Unused for almost 50 years, it has
been one of Mittagundi's achievements to clear it. The group carries some
gear in rucksacks, and two pack horses carry the heavy stuff. Bloggs and
Kate, the half-draught horses, know the track and are used to being led
by different people. They help to set the scene of what to expect at
Mittagundi. This method of reaching Mittagundi provides a way of combining
hiking, high+lighting the remoteness of Mittagundi, and saving enormously
on transport costs. After two days on the track the basic facilities at
Mittagundi seem quite luxurious!
  The group spends four days at Mittagundi itself. Divided into two, each
half runs the base for two days. This means being heavily involved in the
building, running and maintenance of the old-style farm and village. The
other two days are spent on activities such as rafting, ski touring, climbing
and abseiling.
  The trip out takes a day longer than the trip in, partly because of the
1,000 metre climb out of the valley, but also because time is taken to
climb a few peaks of the Bogong High Plains.
  Ian Stapleton firmly believes in having the right `mix' of people at
Mittagundi. He says that is essential for the achievement of its aims, and
is the basis of his philosophy in setting up such a camp.

<h> Succession: handing over the reins of power </h>

<misc> Transferring control of a family business can be fraught with problems,
especially if there is a clash of personalities. Mike Dobbie investigates
the best ways to handle a difficult time </misc>

  Nothing fails like succession when it comes to handing down the family
business. The problems of transferring control are sometimes so great that
the business goes to the pack while the family feuds.
  Comments Ron Flavel, of the Small Business Corporation of South Aus+tralia
(probably joking): "Some children use the banana-skin approach - lay a banana
skin at the top of the stairs and call dad over for a chat. The problem
ends up flat on his back." But advisers stress the need to seek the advice
of experts. Says one Sydney consultant: "The tragedy of family in-fighting
can be prevented if people get help. Other+wise, everyone loses out and
the taxman is the only real winner."
  How should the family business be passed on? What conflicts arise between
parents and their heirs when family succession becomes an issue? Hugh Reid,
of accountants Touche Ross, says small clients often sell the business if
no suitable family member can be found to take over or, when the father
reaches retirement, he looks, for personal reasons, for an outsider in
preference to his children. Reid says a frequent cause of conflict is when
the father does not want to let go his hold on the firm but the son wishes
to introduce new ideas.
   Another problem is the age-old story of the "three-ring circus", where
the first generation makes the business, the second builds it and the third
wrecks it. Says Keith James, another Touche Ross partner, "If the son has
been involved in dad's business for some time, the son is more inclined
to continue to build the business up and maintain a high standard. But the
danger lies in the grandson who has not seen the struggle to establish the
firm. He sees the business as a casual thing and a source of steady income
from little effort. With such a lack of commitment, the grandson erodes
all the effort of his father and grandad."
  Even where a family is sensible about the business, problems keep arising.
Wills are becoming more complex as families battle with the capital gains
tax, which seems to be all-encompassing in terms of estate assets. "We can't
warn people enough just how careful they must be," says a Sydney consultant.
"The tax gives no quarter." His opinion is shared by many other business
advisers. But Gary Higgins, a partner with Arthur Young accountants, says: 
"Owning your business through a family trust can still have capital gains
tax advantages by deferring any tax liability until the business is sold
outside the family."
  Another problem in family succes+sions is the control-from-the-grave factor.
This arises when a will is finely detailed, covering every imprudency an
heir is presumed capable of. Lawyer Norm O'Bryan, of Melbourne solicitors
Gillotts, agrees that the best method to pass on an estate quickly to the
various members of a family is through shares in a company or through a
unit trust. O'Bryan says: "If the parent is a sole trader or in a partnership
it is more difficult to pass down the assets. For certainty of devolution
on death, you need a trust that cannot be inhibited by the people who will
not inherit the assets. It must be transferred readily and that is easiest
with shares or units." 
  O'Bryan warns that discretionary trusts permit the distribution of owner+ship
to be determined by someone else against the original intention of the
testator, "A unit trust is fixed - you know precisely who gets what; it
is the same with shares because the proportion of ownership remains the
same. But  with a discretionary trust the trustee acts as legal owner and
he can determine the control of the income stream to the children independent
of the original owner's wishes. He may decide John should get all of the
estate despite the fact that John's dad hoped it would be shared between John 
and his sister. It may be that with shares or a unit trust one or more children
may decide to sell but the decision is theirs, not someone else's."
  But capital gains tax will always cause problems and O'Bryan recom+mends
that people should seek advice. "Unit trusts are in a sense companies and
under the new legislation they have lost their tax minimisation advantages,"
he says. "People should plan carefully before they decide in what fashion they
will pass on the family firm inheritance."
  How can the family business be structured to ease tensions caused by
transition from parent to progeny? It is a time fraught with danger, say
the specialists. Jealousies can arise when the boss's son moves up the ladder
ahead of employees competing for the top job.
  Says Albert Nelson, general manager of the Small Business Develop+ment
Corporation: "The situation is delicate. Senior people need to be brought
into the picture. A personnel-management exercise is required to involve
top-level employees in the process of transition. You can't just solve it
by offering more money. For these people, their job is their lifestyle as
well as their source of income. If you actively include staff in the changes
and keep them in the picture, then everything should work out."
  Higgins warns that the fur can fly and the morale of employees can be
crippled by nepotism. Staff see the boss's son or daughter as competition
and lose interest if their prospects are threatened. He says it is essential
to keep staff happy by ensuring they can see a career path ahead of them.
Squabbles within families can also spill over into a com+pany and it may
be necessary  to recruit a professional manager to keep relatives at a
distance. 
  Flavel knows of a managing director who felt his family was getting too
much of a say. "It was all getting a bit incestuous," says Flavel. "So he
brought in two outside professionals. One was an accountant and the other
a legal expert. With the injection of new blood and fresh ideas the business
got a view of the real world. They helped to pull the company back into
a business orientation."
  Higgins says: "A buffer zone is needed, particularly in battles among
the children themselves; someone to stand in the middle and keep the com+pany
on track."
  Higgins warns that old people often take too narrow an outlook towards
a firm and this can be a formula for disaster. "In a changing climate with
new legislation the heirs are more in touch with commercial reality," he
says. "We advise that it is best to find a middle line if the father won't
budge."
  There are other ways. Says Flavel: "If the son has to play tough, there are
two options open to him. If he is a director and his father is also on the
board, the son can invoke section 320 of the Com+panies' Code, which gives
a minority shareholder the right to take part in the decision-making. This
forces the father into acknowledging the son's position."
  Flavel cites one case where the antag+onism was resolved in another way:
"There was a business where the son, who was in his fifties and was managing
director, found that his 80-year-old father was still countermanding his
decisions. One day the son got so fed up with the old man's interference
that he sold the company. From that day on the son has not spoken to his
father, who is now 84."
  Steven Kunstler, a senior associate with solicitors Corrs Pavey Whiting
and Byrne, says that smoothe continuity in the family business is more
difficult if children have been kept in a subordinate role by a forceful
father. Kunstler says: "The mistake lies in not involving the children in
the management structure. The two most popular ways of intro+ducing siblings
to the business are through shareholdings or giving the son managerial
responsibility, by possibly heading a division within the firm, to prove
himself." For example, he says, in a building construction firm, the father
can place his sons in control of supply procurement, the construction of
a development itself or the fitting-out.
  Kunstler warns that if families have reached the stage of using section
320 the situation is breaking down. "We're talking about personalities here
and the different business factors make every case different," he says.
"You can't give blanket advice because the factors vary. We find that nine
out of ten cases are resolved before they get too serious. People apply common
sense and know where the best interests of the family lie."
  Generally, European and Asian fami+lies are more successful than Australian
families at maintaining family businesses for generations. They are more
closely bonded and to them the business and family are one. "The close ties
they have allow them to co-operate," says Warren Porter, a partner in the
small business section of Deloitte Haskins and Sells in Sydney. "Traditionally,
the father is the head of the household and he dictates what the children
do. You find that if a member of the family gets into trouble, everyone
pitches in to help. Australian families are less inclined to help each other
in times of strife. We tend to look after number one. The close bond that
ethnic families have contribute to the success they enjoy during the transition
from father to children."
  Albert Nelson, of the Small Business Development Corporation, says there
are generally three scenarios for family succession, each with a difficult 
trans+ition phase. The most obvious is when the heir has been working in the 
firm for some years. Nelson says: "The important thing is for there to be an 
exchange of views so that mutual goals can be realised. We advise that the 
parties involved first describe the company as they see it and what they want 
for it in the future. You will often find the son has a different picture from 
his father. These views need to be analysed and eventually, a common plan agreed
upon."
  A frank exchange of views is also essential if the son comes from the
academic world. "There is a danger with the son wanting to implement all
the new ideas he has learned," says Nelson. "The transition period must
be treated carefully as an on-going phase to introduce the two parties to
each other in terms of what they want for the firm. The idea of new technology
can be used as a threatening device. The father often cannot accept the
need in the business he established for the fast pro+cessing of material.
He is unable to make hard decisions aided by the hi-tech of the modern
business. He is scared and uncertain. The youngster feels con+fined by his
father's thinking. He sees the old guard as retarding progress. Violent
personality clashes often occur in this scenario. Our advice is for both
to go and get involved in the new tech+nology and in shop-floor activities.
This kind of external training together is the best way to resolve the lack
of under+standing and appreciation they have for each other."
  The most sudden and debilitating event in family transition is when the
son must take over due to illness, but Nelson says this is usually the most
successful. "In this situation, the respon+sibility is suddenly thrust upon
the heir. The survival instinct becomes para+mount because this is not a
takeover; it requires total application from the heir when he is thrown
into that kind of thing. He is often fortunate in that he has inherited
an interest in the firm and is familiar with it. That conditioning makes
the family more comfortable. We usually see kids from the country cope well
in this situation as they have a better understanding for their dad's farm
than city kids who are less certain when caught in the business cross-section."
  What should dad do to prepare him+self to let go of the reins?

What would you do if the Family Law Court forbade you to see your children?
  
  It's almost midnight when Steve, a labourer*laborer, gets on the phone to the
crowd he's read about in the Sunday papers: Fathers Against Discrimin+ation in
Childcare.
  "I can't get in my own house!" he cries. "The bitch reckons I beat her
up ... so I get home and she's got a bit of paper say+ing I can't come in
my own house ..."
  "Whoa!" pleads FADIC organiser Dean Weily. "Start at the beginning." He
lights a cigarette, dreading what will follow. Steve groans as though his
search for the "be+ginning" is causing him physical pain.
  "Look, I just want to know what law says I can't go in my own house! You
tell me what fucking law stops a man ... Jeez, I been making payments on
the bastard for six years! So where's the justice, eh? Where's it say I
can't ..."
  Weily grips his hair (Steve's voice con+veys an infectious sense of
desperation). Slowly, carefully, Weily explains that a magistrate or a
judge can make any rul+ing concerning property that he or she sees fit.
It's known as an ex parte ruling and is intended to protect the applicant
from ...
  "But where's the law!" Steve demands. "Where's it written that a man can
be kicked out of his own fucking house? I've called the cops, my local member,
now you. No-one can show me the bloody law that says it!"
  Dean Weily hangs up half an hour later with a familiar feeling of futility:
Steve has not understood. He will probably spend weeks looking for a law
that doesn't exist. In the end he might go over the edge and take out his
fury on his wife, or his children ... or even on the magistrate who made
the ex parte order.
  Not for the first time, Weily - self-appointed adviser to thousands of
Aus+tralian men caught up in the grim complex+ities of divorce, child custody
and access - sees the enemy face-to-face. It is con+fusion ... the kind of
confusion that spawns despair. Weily thinks of the in+numerable "Steves"
out there, each trapped in the quagmire of his own befud+dled anguish. Since
he launched FADIC only a couple of months earlier, the young Brisbane
businessman had listened to hundreds of them. Despite FADIC's avowed purpose
(to change percep+tions of men as solitary parents and to fo+cus attention
or perceived flaws in the Family Court system) Weily, 27, can't dis+guise
early misgivings.
  A few days before, he'd told me: "I just want to find out why so many
apparently rational individuals go into the [Family] Court system and emerge
as lunatics who do desperate things ..." But tonight he wonders: is it possible
to achieve anything amidst so much mental chaos?
  "Help me! Help me! moan the voices on his phone. "I'm going to waste myself!"
the voices scream, or more alarmingly: "Nothing matters now."
  Each caller has a separate story of trage+dy and injustice, against a
background of legal battles of astonishing vindictiveness and torturous
complexity. Who's sane and who's crazy? Who's lying and who isn't? Who's
seeking attention and who's a bona fide psychotic?
 Dean Weily smokes another cigarette, staring from his window at the lights
of the city. "Jesus," he whispers. "This is a bloody nightmare ..."

<h> News Report - 19.12.85 </h>

... A Cairns man who abducted his daughter from her mother's custody and
made her live as a fugitive for 18 months was jailed for 15 months.
  Mr Justice Simpson in the Brisbane Fa+mily Court sentenced Allan Lindsay
Sealey, 38, to 15 months jail from the time of his arrest in Perth on November
27, to be released after 10 months subject to a $1000 bond relating to certain
conditions.
  The conditions obliged Sealy to seek a fresh application for access to
his daugh+ter and restrained him from entering or loitering near his wife's
premises. Sealey pleaded guilty to contempt of an access order following
a "bitterly contested" four-day custody hearing in March last year be+fore
Mr Justice Simpson.
  Mrs Rhonda Sealey, 34, said in Cairns yesterday she feared her husband
would try again to take their daughter Jayde, 7, when he was released from
jail. "He told me he would never give her up," she said. "But I don't know
whether prison is the right place for him. He needs psychiatric help."
  
  Alan Sealey is slight and sandy-haired; he stands waiting in the prison
visiting area with a big plastic bag full of newspaper and magazine articles,
sworn affidavits, legal transcripts and letters. He puts the bag be+tween
us on the table and watches me at+tentively, his eyes red-rimmed and his
skin pallid. 
  I ask if he is ill. Sealey shakes his head.
  "Prison is terrible," he says softly, almost apologetically. He smiles
and rests a hand on the plastic bag, staring down the long table where men
with tattooed arms sit opposite exhausted-looking women in cheap clothes.
  For 90 minutes we discuss what Sealey did on the run with his daughter
... how they lived for nine months in a religious community in Western Australia
and how, on November 27 last year, the forlorn esca+pade ended when Jayde
was recognised in a small WA town by an off-duty police+man who'd seen pictures
of her in New Idea and on TV. ("Sweetheart, please tell someone who you are
- maybe your teacher or a policeman. Don't be afraid my darling; Mummy is
waiting for you and I love you with all my heart." <misc>- Rhonda Sealey, New
Idea, 2.2.85)</misc>
  Why did Sealey run? Why did he fail to return Jayde to her mother after
a normal access outing on May 5, 1984? He told me his reason many times,
but because of res+trictions imposed by the Family Law Act, I cannot quote
him.
  I can quote a letter written by Sealey and read to the court after he
was sentenced on the contempt charge: "I honestly be+lieved, and still do
believe very strongly, that Jayde is in very real moral danger by her continual
exposure to the letter named one of the child's maternal relatives and the
home environment of my former wife," he wrote.
  "I am remorseful for having been in con+tempt, however my mind was in
such a state of mental exhaustion, having the con+tinuing worry of my child's
safety and hav+ing been involved in many court battles, that I took steps
that perhaps only I under+stand as the father of Jayde."
  In other court reports, Sealey's barrister Leo White says his client's
fight was trig+gered by claims by Jayde that she had been sexually molested.
Barrister Graeme Page, for Mrs Sealey, told the court the sex+ual incidents
Allan Sealey complained of had been raised in earlier court hearings and
had been "explained as not in any way sexually abusive or arousing."
  But Mr Page's next reported assertion - that Sealey had not raised the
"inci+dents" until interviewed on the radio on the run in October last year
and that he had not attempted to "engage in the legal processes open to
him" - seems to con+tradict his statement that the incidents had been raised
during earlier court hearings.
  In fact, a sworn affidavit exists in which a close relative of Rhonda
Sealey raises these sexual indidents in support of Allan Sealey's bid for
custody of Jayde. Accord+ing to transcripts from the Sealeys' custo+dy hearing
- also before Mr Justice Simpson in Brisbane - an attempt by Sealey's barrister
to introduce this affidavit as evidence was rejected by the judge, who
described it as "character assassi+nation."
  Before "stealing" his daughter and hit+ting the road in his Kombi van,
the ex-photographer had discussed his concern over the sexual incidents
with the Bishop of Cairns, a Member of Parliament and others. Apparently,
their advice was unani+mous: Sealey could not hope to win a crimi+nal case.
  At the prison, Sealey tells me he intend+ed to hide from the world with
Jayde until she was 11 - an age, he believes, when she would be able to
make her own judge+ments about what would be best for her future.
  "Yesterday," he says, looking at the big plastic bag, "I got a letter
from Rhonda. She told me Jayde would not be writing to me anymore ... or
seeing me."
  He looks away.
  "Jayde's welfare was always my main concern ... When I get out, I will
apply for access to visit her. I would not take her away again - that was
a mistake. But be+cause of the conditions of my early release, it'll probably
be at least a year after I get out [in September this year] before I can
even see her."
  ("I just don't believe the sentence is se+vere enough. He said on television
he would do it again. How safe is Jayde once he gets out? He could come
up here and take her out again and the whole nightmare would start all over.
If the sentence had been five years, it would have given her time to grow
up. Ten months is nothing."<misc> - Rhonda Sealey, New Idea, 1.2.86)</misc>
  I ask Sealey how much time he spends thinking about his problems.
  "All of it," he says. He picks up his plas+tic bag and walks off toward the
cell block ... a small man with red eyes, the sub+ject of just one of about
400 warrants for child abduction sworn out yearly in this country.

  Since it replaced the nasty old Matrimoni+al Causes Act in 1975, the Family
Law Act has been hailed as a brilliant piece of refor+mist legislation and
damned as the cause of untold misery, violence and tragedy.
  It's made divorce more "civilised" by do+ing away with the need for tacky
accusa+tions of adultery and cruelty and the use of private investigators,
but - critics say - it's done nothing to improve the three worst problem
areas: custody, main+tenance payments and property division.
  Conciliate, don't litigate - the Family Law catchphrase - has worked to
the ex+tent that 90 percent of Australian divorces are now settled outside
the courtroom ... with the divorce rate now running at about one in three.
Yet, although Family Court rul+ings on custody squabbles involve only a
tiny percentage of separating couples, the aftermath of those decisions
has some+times been horrendous.
  In NSW, particularly, there's been a wave of terror directed at the Family
Court system, with five attacks on judges since 1980. These include the
shooting of Mr Justice David Opas in Sydney and the bombing of the home
of Mr Justice Wat+son in 1984, a tragedy that took the life of the Judge's
wife, Pearl.
  In October 1985 a Perth father, dis+traught over a Family Court ruling giving
custody of their three children to his wife, drove to an isolated area with
the young+sters and took his and their lives by feed+ing a hosepipe from
the exhaust to its interior.
  Another West Australian, Terry Douglas, became what single fathers' groups
call a "runner" after a Family Court awarded custody to his ex-wife. Captured
with his abducted kids in Queensland, Douglas was returned to Melbourne
and jailed for 18 months for contempt. Near death after a 52-day hunger
strike, Douglas was released from Pentridge prison - winning the battle
but, so far, not the war: he has had no access to his children since 1980.
  Right across the nation, thousands of dis+gruntled men (and even a few
women) have banded together under various names - Divorce Law Reform, Men's
Confraternity, Lone Fathers, Families Against Unnecessary Legal Trauma,
etc - to proclaim their outrage against the "sys+tem" and to try to change
it.
  Their main grievance, hotly denied by Family Court judges and their backup
net+work of social workers, counsellors and Le+gal Aid solicitors, is that
the system favors women ... and that statistics used by the Family Court
(especially the oft-quoted claim that fathers get custody of at least one
child in 41 percent of contested cases) do not accurately portray the
situation.

<source> Drought or Deluge: Man in the Cooper's Creek Region - 1986 </source>

<note> 2038 words </note>

<h> Cultures in conflict </h>

Charles Sturt, the first European to see the tribesmen of the Cooper, found
them an attractive people: `The men of this tribe were, without exception,
the finest I had seen on the Australian continent ... a well-made race.'
This opinion was repeated by both Alfred Howitt and John McKinlay of the
Burke and Wills relief expeditions, who com+mented favourably on their physical
appearance, apparent health and physical prowess, Sturt also admired their
temperament, commenting that they were in his opinion `naturally a mild
and inoffensive people', although remarkably brave when faced with exotic
beasts and strange men. Wills however thought them `easily frightened, and,
although fine-looking men, decidedly not of warlike disposition ... They appear
to be meanspirited and contemptible in every respect'. How+ever, returned
from the journey to the Gulf, starving and ill, Wills could refer to them
as `our friends the blacks', and gratefully accept the shelter, food and
friendship they offered. Howitt rewarded the Cooper people for their kindness
to King and left the Cooper confi+dent that he had ensured a friendly reception
for any future white travellers in the region.
  As inhabitants of an environment possessing resources adequate for their
own use but rarely allowing abundance over a long period, the Aborigines
had shown themselves willing to extend limited hospitality to small parties
of strangers passing through their country. Settlers, however, building
huts on the best campsites and herding cattle over their hunting range,
were recognized as intruders who threatened the finely balanced existence
of the local people. Once the initial awe abated and the white man was seen
to be a vulnerable human being, attempts were made to eject him.
  There was only one organized attempt to resist the alienation of the Cooper
tribal territories. In April 1867 the Sub-Protector of Abori+gines in the
Far North, John Buttfield, reported to the South Austra+lian Aborigines'
Office:
  
  I have the honor to inform you that having accompanied Sergeant
  Wauchop and eight Troopers to Lake Hope, Kopperamana, Killalpaninna and
  Lake Gregory I am now on my way south to Headquarters. The Natives that had
  collected in large numbers at Perigundi, including the Deerea [Dieri],
  Koonaree, Ominee [Ngameni] Yarrawarraka [Yaura+worka], Cuddibirie,
  Yandrawandra [Yantruwanta] and Pilladappa tribes have dispersed. It appeared
  from information I gathered that an unusually large concourse assembled
  at Perigundi - had a very grand Corroboree in the month of March and then
  there devised a plan for exterminating the whole of the Settlers as far
  south as Blanchewater. It was their inten+tion to murder the Missionaries
  first of all. The timely and unexpected arrival of three Police Troopers
  from Lake Hope prevented the execution of their diabolical intention.

  Anthropologists have suggested that sorcery was possibly the means intended
to be used to expel the settlers, but in fact the Mission Station was in
a state of physical siege by the end of march. The list of tribes given
by Buttfield suggests that the people who had seen most of the white man
on the Cooper - those in the Innamincka region - recognized him as a threat
to their lands and lent at least moral support to the resistance movement.
  Individuals met with local resistance to their settlement along the river.
John Conrick, left alone at Goonbabinna for two months, was aware that he
was in some danger and slept armed, with his dogs guarding the door of his
hut. The Cooper people watched from a distance as he weeded and watered
his vegetable garden, milked his cows, and rode with his dogs among the
cattle. As the days went by and no other white man appeared, they resolved
to rid themselves of the intruder.
  One morning, just before first light, about two hundred of the Wongkumara
people surrounded the hut. Conrick wrote later:
  
  Suddenly my dogs charged out and attacked something which I at first thought
  was a dingo, but when it yelled I knew at once that it was a black+fellow
  and that an attack had been planned. I looked at my two revolvers, which
  were always in the belt around my waist day and night, and then hurriedly
  inspected the gun and rifle and found all the weapons ready.
    Meanwhile the nigger who had been seized by the dogs was having a bad
  time, and I determined to save his life, although I knew he was after mine.
  I put my head out cautiously and whistled the dogs off ... the black+fellow
  ... was badly bitten and torn, but I saw that he would recover ... I made
  him understand that I did not intend to kill him and that if he crawled
  to an old wurley about 400 yards away his friends would find him ..
    That night the whole story travelled far, and it was known that I had
  savage dogs and that I had spared the life of the man who had gone to kill
  me. I never again had any trouble with the blacks, and could do almost 
  anything with them ...

  While this is the only detailed account of such an encounter remain+ing,
there were probably other similar occurrences; the possibility is implicit
in the comments of an unidentified Cooper pioneer who in 1878 wrote to a
friend, refering to the Aborigines:

  They are very harmless fellows when kept in their place, but treacherous
  if too well treated; they have a great respect for me, the reason of which
  is that I keep a good supply of physic such as Holloway's pills and ointment,
  pain-killer, chlorodyne, salts, etc., and never go about without a revolver
  in my belt - just that they may see it.
  
  On the whole the Aboriginal inhabitants allowed themselves to be dispossessed
of their waterholes and hunting grounds with no more than token protest.
As Conrick found, a show of strength won their respect and, while the white
man remained for many years wary of the Aborigines along the Cooper, there
were only isolated examples of confrontation.
  The differences between the two cultures were most easily comprehended
at the superficial level. In 1881 an observer at Elder's Perricherrie Station
on the Cooper described the Aborigines:

  They are even too lazy to get food, although they occasionally go out
  on hunting expeditions. They are disgusting and beastly filthy in their
  habits. Cleanliness is studiously avoided even in their eating, sand,
  charcoal and ashes all helping to fill up. They also eat fleas and lice,
  with which they abound. Their ceremonies - making wind, rain, rats, etc.,
  are simply orgies for the display of disgusting vices. Their corroborees,
  too, are mostly a combination of obscene expressions. There is not one
  redeeming trait in their character, and it is only fear of the whites
  which keeps them in subjection ...
                                 
  These were the attitudes of the white population generally and not confined
to the settlers around Cooper Creek. There was no under+standing on the
white man's part of the culture of the people - worse, there was no awareness
of its existence. The visible manifestations of his complex and intensely
satisfying spiritual life were dismissed as loathesome superstition, his
social customs as incomprehensible oddities, his nakedness and his dances
labelled obscene. His inability to care adequately for the clothes the white
man insisted that he wear resulted in a litter of filthy rags which further
prejudiced the white community against him.
  There was however an even deeper gulf between the cultures which was
then, as now, the least understood of all the many differ+ences between
the races. This was the concept of land ownership.
  To the Aborigine, the idea that a man could own the earth from which he
came was unthinkable. Man was an integral part of the land, from which his
spirit emanated and to which it returned, so that man could no more be
separated from his country than the rocks and earth which formed its physical
being. The spiritual bond between land and man gave him the right to range
over his country at will during his life+time, the benefits of its
fruitfulness, and a resting place for his soul after his death. Land and
Man were one, in perpetuity.
  In European eyes, land is a commodity to be owned or traded as circumstances
dictate; that ownership precludes the free movement of others over the land,
and the products of that land become the sole property of the owner. The
two philosophies are totally incompatible, and it was the mutual inability
to understand that any viewpoint other than one's own existed that caused
the most anger and bewilderment on both sides. The Aborigines did not recognize
that the building of a hut and the introduction of strange animals could
prevent them from ranging freely over their own country; the white man could
not under+stand why the Aborigine persistently trespassed on private property
and speared animals which did not belong to him.
  Nevertheless, although the presence of the white man disrupted the
Aborigine's way of life and required him to adapt his material culture to
fit the new circumstances, it in no way altered his philos+ophy. He remained
confidently at one with his country, knowing his true place in the cosmos
and continuing the ceremonies which he believed maintained that cosmos until
well into the twentieth century. The friction which arose between the races
was not therefore over land ownership - both races being equally secure
on that point - but over the use of the land.
  An example of the conflict caused by restrictions on Aboriginal freedom
of movement occurred in the early days on Haddon Downs. Haddon was situated
on the traditional route between the Cooper and the pituri country of western
Queensland, along which passed a heavy traffic with parties of men
loaded down with blankets and clothing to barter for pituri. Overseer John
Howe claimed to have had trouble with the Aborigines in the early days when
the station was first occupied, and interference with this important
traditional trade was probably the cause.
  The wanderings of the Aborigines were usually accepted as an unavoidable
evil by the settlers, but their presence near water needed for stock was
undesirable. Everywhere, the Aborigine was driven away in dry seasons from
the good waterholes to make room for the cattle, and if he returned he was
harassed, somtimes shot at, and moved on again until the lesson was learned.
  Having accepted the white man, however reluctantly, as a perman+ent fact
of life, the Aborigines made the best of things. For the white man's tomahawk,
cast-off clothes, kerosene tins and tobacco they acted as guides through
the country they knew so intimately; for rations and a little money to exchange
for clay pipes, moleskin trousers and bright bandanas they learned to ride
the horses which had so terrified their fathers, and became shepherds and
stockmen among the beasts which had ousted them from their waterholes. They
exchanged the freedom to wander for a wide-brimmed hat, the hurly-burly
of the muster and a permanent camp near the homestead with a regular supply
of beef offal. The men made themselves indispensable to the settlers with
their seemingly instinctive skill with horses, intimate knowledge of the
seasons and the waters, and ability to track straying stock and lost white
men over difficult terrain.
  The stations remained predominantly male communities, so Abori+ginal women
too had their uses; if this was ever the cause of conflict between the races,
no record remains even in local folklore. When white women did come, like
Mrs Colless on Innamincka and Mrs Burkitt on Tinga Tingana in the 1870s,
a few Aboriginal women could be trained to housework. Aboriginal women were
also used as messengers, carrying papers and goods to the construction camps
on Cordillo Downs, and carrying the mail from Cordillo to Haddon Downs.
They also worked as shepherds and at the woolscours at shearing time.
  One settler was grateful for the Aboriginal women's ability to forage:

  I am not altogether without vegetable food, as I get the blacks to bring
  me a lot of `yougher', a small root about the size of a large pea, which
  has the appearance of a small onion, with a taste, when cooked, between
  a raw potato and a dried pea.

<source> Uluru, An Aboriginal History of Ayers Rock </source>

<note> 2015 words </note>   

<h> Living off the land </h>

Aboriginal people have probably lived aound Uluru for over 10 000 years.
Excavations in the James Range, 80 kilometres east of Alice Springs, produced
material more than 10 000 years old (Gould, n.d., p.8), and the more recent
excavation at Puntutjarpa, 400 kilometres west of Uluru, in Western Australia,
uncovered camp debris shown by radiocarbon dating to be about 10 200 years
old (Gould, 1971, p.165). Richard Gould found that, despite small changes
in the stone tools of different ages in Puntutjarpa rockshelter, the evidence
was generally of `a stable hunting and foraging way of life which can be
regarded as the Australian desert culture' (Gould 1971, p.174).
  The culture was a subsistence one; that is, the people produced all they
needed locally and, unlike the Europeans who brought the pastoral economy
to central Australia, did not specialise in the production of single foods.
The only things traded were ceremonial items, such as pearl shell from
Australia's north coast. To supply all their needs from the semi-desert
in which they live, people must know where to look for many different animals
and plants, and where water, scarce as it is, can be found.
  Pitjantjatjara dialects recognise at least four distinct types of country:
the mulga flats, open sand dunes, rocky hills and the encircling trees around
rock faces such as those at Uluru. Each must be visited from time to time
to obtain vital resources - different parts of the bush favour different
plant species and animals also have their favoured habitats. Water is never
present in large quantities.  Rain falls irregularly to fill rock holes
among the hills and replenish soaks in dry creek beds, where the sand can
be dug away until water seeps into the hole. The Aborigines moved
opportunistically, retiring to base camps in drought, spreading out after
rain.
  
<h> Useful plants </h>

The semi-desert country around Uluru is a varied one. In open country,
sandhills alternate with low-lying flats, and many useful plants grow in
each environment. Spinifex, desert oaks and light scrub grow on the windblown
sand of the dunes, and mulga grows on the intervening flats.
According to Peter Latz (1978, p.81), the largest variety of food plants
is found on the sandhills, yet this is also the habitat where drinking water
is most scarce.
  Mulga seeds were ground for flour. Mulga wood is used to make spear-throwers,
throwing sticks and coolamons (wooden bowls). The Ayers Rock mulga grows
long, straight branches, which are shaped into heavy stabbing spears called
winta. The roots of the witchetty bush, which also grows on mulga flats,
are dug up and broken open to take out the witchetty grubs: one side of
the bush growing less well than the other is a sign that grubs are in the
roots. Another clue is the presence of discarded skins of adult insects
that have emerged. The seeds of woolly-butt grass and `native millet', which
also grow in mulga country, were harvested and ground to make flour, from
which unleavened bread was baked in the ashes of a fire. The red flowers
of the Eremophila bush are filled with a sugary nectar, which can be sucked
from the base of the flower.
  In the sandhills, different types of plant can be found growing on the
ridges and in the hollows. On the ridges grow a grevillea with nectar-filled
flowers, and also wild `plum' trees. The Gyrostemon tree provides lightweight
timber for carving carrying dishes. Emu-poison bush provided poison which
was put in water where emus came to drink; the leaves of ilpara, waterbush,
were burnt to an ash and mixed with the `chewing tobacco' picked from the
base of rock faces at Uluru. In the hollows, at the foot of desert oaks,
grows a solanum with an edible fruit, sometimes called a wild tomato, which
is considered to taste like a grape. Spinifex grass provides natural gum,
which was used to mount the stone blade on the end of a spear-thrower. The
desert `poplar', a botanical relative of Gyrostemon, also grows in the
sandhills, and its soft wood is sometimes used for animal carvings.
  The steep rock faces of Uluru and Katatjuta harbour different species:
Ilyi, the rock fig and a wild `plum', which, although classed botanically
with the sandhill species, is given a different name by the Pitjantjatjara.
The tumbled boulders at the foot of rock faces are the source of `chewing
tobacco', and light hunting spears are made from the spear bush, urtjanpa.
  In the Petermanns and Musgraves, more gentle hill slopes predominate.
Here distinctive species of acacia grow, including utjalpara, a source of
witchetty grubs and a sweet gum exuded by insects which Aboriginal children
liked to suck. One middle-aged man explained, `I often got a lolly from
that one when I was a little boy.'
  Rain falling on the vast expanses of bare rock at Uluru, Katatjuta and
smaller outcrops flows out across the surrounding soil before soaking away.
These sheet-flooding zones harbour flourishing colonies of bloodwood trees.
Bloodwood provides timber for making several types of coolamon, including
the deep bowls called piti, the scoops called wirra, and spear-throwers.
Between the bloodwoods can be found a low, crawling plant with a red, fleshy
stem called wakati, which bears a seed that was ground to make flour. The
grass kunakanti, which also has edible seeds, grows here, as does an edible
solanum. Different species of eucalypt grow beside creeks: Apara, river
red gum (Eucalyptus camaldulensis), grows along Britten-Jones Creek and
gives its name to the soak, creek and country, Aparanya; in the vicinity
of Docker River, the ghost gum (Eucalyptus papuana) also occurs. River red
gum and ghost gum provide wood for coolamons and other artefacts.

<h> Animal habitats </h>

Many animals tend to live in only one of these plant habitats. The red
kangaroo is restricted to level grassland and is mainly found on the mulga
flats; the euro feeds in spinifex on hill and rock slopes (Frith 1973, pp.273
and 281). Although the emu lives in sandhill country, it was often caught
near water, either by covering the main rock hole with stones and poisoning
smaller pools, or by spearing the birds as they came to drink. Men hid behind
artificial stone hides or natural boulders, because emus which drank poisoned
water would try to regurgitate and the hunters had to rush out to wrestle
with the birds, keeping their beaks shut.

<h> Change in subsistence activities </h>

Some plants, such as spinifex and the wild plum, grow in more than one habitat,
and resources such as nectar or wood for coolamons and spear-throwers can
be obtained from more than one species, but each habitat must have been
regularly exploited for its unique resources. The disappearance of traditional
subsistence activities would have as big an impact on the region's ecology
as the extinction of one of the main animal species, but Aboriginal people
still rely on the bush for many things. Kangaroo and euro meat are preferred
to beef; so is rabbit. Artefacts for sale are still made from traditional
materials. Withetty grubs are enjoyed. At Kikingkura outstation we saw edible
berries harvested. Although this was not done regularly by the people living
at Uluru, children were quick to pick wild `plums' and `tomatoes' when
they could, during expeditions to the sandhills.
  One of the biggest changes since White contact has been the disappearance
of controlled burning of the bush. Peter Latz (1978) writes that many of
the most important food plants appear during the early stages of regrowth
after minor fires, and that controlled burning of small patches of bush
was an everyday part of foraging expeditions. Early explorers repeatedly
found parties of Aboriginal people firing the land. Since people have been
gathered into missions or settled around station homesteads, regular burning
has largely ceased. In the 1970s several years of good rainfall caused a
build up of inflammable scrub, grass and branches, resulting in disastrous
wildfires that swept over wide areas in the Uluru National Park during 1976.
  Aboriginal diet has also changed since contact. It is thought that when
people were entirely dependent on the bush for food, meat made up only 20
to 30 per cent of the diet (see Gould 1969a). With traditional weapons,
animals such as kangaroo or euro were hard to catch. Paddy Uluru once recalled
how as a young man he had killed a kangaroo at Tjulu (now the site of Curtin
Springs homestead) and carried it back to Uluru, a distance of 80 kilometres.
Richard Gould, living with people in the bush in Western Australia during
1966 to 1967, found that the women produced an average of 4.5 kilograms
of vegetable food each day, devoting 4 1/2 hours to collection and 2 1/2 hours
to preparation, while the men found only lizards. Although reliable, collecting
vegetable foods could be hard work. Peter Brokensha asked Pitjantjatjara
women living at an outstation from Amata to make damper from wild millet,
kaltu kaltu (Brokensha 1975, p.25). He found that to gather less than 2
kilograms of seed from an area within 1 kilometre of their camp took three
women 3 hours. To grind, winnow and cook the seed took another 2 hours.
Although, as he says, there was a mad scramble among the camp's children
for a piece of the cooking, it is not surprising that purchased flour has
almost completely replaced indigenous sources. At Yuendumu in the mid-1970s,
almost 30 per cent by weight of purchased food was flour; at Yalata a family
of five would buy 11 kilograms of white flour a week (figures cited in Peterson
1978, p.32; see also Rose 1965,pp.31-2; Cutter 1978, p.67 and Brokensha
1975, p.25).
  The amount of meat obtained from the bush has, on the other hand, probably
increased, not only because guns are more effective than spears, but also
because cattle grazing and bore water help kangaroos to flourish (Frith
1978, p.90). The introduced rabbit has also become a major source of meat.
At Brokensha's outstation, rabbits were eaten practically all the time (1975).
W.V. MacFarlane, who briefly visited two outstations in Western Australia
during the 1960s, records that at Kutjuntari seven euros were shot in eight
days, and at Warawiya the men, using .22 rifles `brought in a kangaroo almost
every day' (1978, pp.51 and 54).
  Appendix C lists the observed hunting trips made by people at Uluru during
the period of my fieldwork. There is no reason to think the euro or the
kangaroo, let alone the rabbit, is threatened, because people's subsistence
needs limit the amount of hunting. The only threat to natural resources
seems to be that of commercial exploitation. D. Roff suggests that the
brushtail possum became locally extinct during early contact times because
too many were killed to sell their skins to White men (1976, p.15). Sedentary
life also exacerbates the local depletion of resources around camps, which
is one of the reasons people in settlements rely more on purchased foods.
N.B Tindale's comments on traditional camps (quoted below) suggest that
this may always have been a problem.

<h> Traditional artefacts </h>

Traditional Western Desert tools and implements have been described by
Brokensha (1975) and B. Hayden (1979). Brokensha describes how the
spear-thrower is made from a slab of wood split from a mulga tree using
metal tools; Hayden described how stone tools were used for the same purpose.
The same technique is used to obtain wood for wooden bowls, throwing sticks
and other implements. Paddy Uluru used axe blades as far as possible as
wedges rather than cutting tools, paralleling the way in which Hayden shows
stone wedges and axes to have been used. This technique does not kill the
tree from which the wood is obtained. Both Hayden and Brokensha describe
how digging sticks and spears are made. Only the straightest of urtjanpa
limbs are suitable for making spears. They are cut at the base and pulled
downwards out of the tangled mass of intertwined branches. Twigs must be
trimmed off, traditionally with a stone adze, like those mounted on
spear-throwers, and the stem straightened by warming it in a fire.

<h> CHAPTER 3 </h>

<h> The Nurses </h>

In March 1912 Victoria had a mere half dozen bush nursing centres, New South
Wales had four and Tasmania just one. South Australia was still considering
whether to send district nurses north into the outback, although five country
towns in the south-east were already served. A Melbourne Herald writer felt
bound to trumpet the virtues of this hand+ful of women:
  
Of all women workers, perhaps the Australian bush nurse stands highest ...
A nurse with a heart, brain and education can tell the young mother just
what she should know, just what the State school utterly failed to teach
her ... if she happens to be a woman fit for the position, (she) is the
true missionary ... (bush nurses) often do the work of doctor, servant and
nurse combined. More than that ... they think healthy thoughts ... and inspire
their patients with something of their own feelings. 

  Such fulsome praise could have rebounded against the fledgling move+ment.
Other branches of the nursing profession were as dedicated to ideals which
were given lofty expression in the first issue of Una, the Victorian Trained
Nurses Association journal, in 1903. Its summary concluded:

Nursing is today an Art and a Science; Art is as wide as Truth itself, and
Science to quote the admirable dictum of Huxley is `nothing more than trained
and organized common sense'.

  Besides ignoring the work of other nurses, the Herald's portrait of a
paragon slighted doctors, educationists, missionaries and servants.
Nev+ertheless, the bush nurse did stand somewhat apart, even in the climate
of rising professionalism among nurses.
  In the first two decades of the twentieth century few nurses were employed
in public hospitals once they were through their training. Those who were <note> commer missing </note> battled to improve nursing conditions such as the poor quality of hospital
food and working longer than their rostered shift. They were often on duty
for ten or twelve hours. Their last resort was resignation, sometimes en
masse as happened at the Women's Hospital in April 1912. The RVTNA, however,
was loath to sanction public nego+tiation on hospital salaries, fearing
that it would be likened to a trade union or accused of overburdening a
charity. Some certificated nurses worked in private hospitals, especially
the newer ones which accepted only trained staff. But generally they took
on private cases, working from a `home' run by an experienced nurse who
acted as manager, taking calls and alotting jobs.
  In this private area the RVTNA was keen to set fee levels which were not
to be undercut. The daily rate was 10s 6d for twelve hours and double that
for twenty-four hours. When a nurse was engaged on a weekly basis and lived
in the patient's house the fee was 2&pound; 7s 6d for ordinary cases,
2&pound; 18s for midwifery and 3&pound; 8s 6d for serious cases. These
included fevers and infections, mental and alcoholic conditions, the first
week of pneumonia and care after major operations. In these cases the nurse
was to be allowed, `if possible', two hours for outside exercise each day
and at least six consecutive hours for sleep.  Although private nurses'
weekly earnings might be twice or even three times more than those of hospital
nurses, their board and lodging had to be paid between `home' cases as well
as during longer leave.
  The RVTNA was careful to see that the principles underlying these fees
and conditions were not infringed by the bush nursing scheme. The Association
similarly scrutinized the formation in June 1910 of a visiting nurses
scheme, whereby a private nurse took on a number of patients, visiting them
once or twice a day while instructing relatives or friends in their full-time
care. The scheme was aimed at those who could not afford a resident nurse.
By 1919 the Visiting Nurses Association was operating in many Melbourne
suburbs including Coburg and in provin+cial cities like Bendigo. To encourage
expansion, the Association then adopted `the co-operative principle', meaning 
that annual subscribers could call on the nurses free of charge.
  It was the isolation of the bush nurse from medical and hospital support
which made her role distinct from that of hospital, visiting, private or
district nurse. She was called on to exercise high levels of intiative,
independence and often ingenuity. There was also her work with school children
and their parents in promoting health care and preventive medicine. This
was well received from the outset and often surprisingly productive.
  Following the pattern established at Beech Forest, Education depart+ment
subsidies were granted to new centres according to the number of isolated
schools the nurse was able to visit. By 1917 this grant amounted to 250&pound;
a year but that total remained the same while new centres were constantly
being created, so some received no subsidy at all. Almost without exception
these centres encouraged their nurses to do school visiting and bore the
full cost of her salary unassisted. Local committees had often been stirred 
by the talk, illustrated by a set of lantern slides prepared in 1914, which the
Association's travelling superintendent Miss E.M. Greer gave in districts
which registered interest in obtaining a bush nurse. The school visits always
prompted the most questions from the audience and swung many who had been
undecided into support for the scheme.
  In outlining the duties and responsibilities of the nurse to schools the
Education department asked in 1911 that suggestions and criticisms to help
develop the usefulness of the work be added to the monthly report of the
school visits. The nurse could instruct parents how to deal with minor ailments
such as sores, cuts and chilblains. Printed instructions were issued on
steps to be taken when hair, skin or clothing was unclean, usually
vermin-infested. By promptly recognizing infectious diseases and fevers,
and skin conditions such as scabies or ringworm, treatment including the
child's exclusion from school could be arranged. Parents were to be instructed
about chronic conditions such as discharg+ing ears and conjunctivitis, and
encouraged to get medical attention for any serious condition. Where there
was evidence that children were seriously neglected or overworked the matter
was to be reported to the department's medical officers. Children who were
repeatedly absent from school through illness could be visited at home to
try to identify any contributing cause.
  By 1918 superintendent Greer claimed noticeable improvements in the health
and cleanliness of children in out-of-the-way places where the nurse visited.
This was confirmed by the laconic report of one local committee that parents
always knew when the nurse's visit was due because their children paid
extraordinary attention to soap and water that morning. Small measures such
as a water mug for each child and separate pegs for hats and coats lessened
cross-infection.
  Poor diet was still a handicap to better health. An intake of little besides
corned beef, white bread and sugary tea was identified by Greer as the cause
of teeth decaying before they were through the gums, two and three-year-olds
unable to walk because of undeveloped limbs, and backwardness in education
levels by up to two years. The same diet meant that men at fifty or even
forty were no longer fit for work. Milk was seldom used by households, even
in dairying districts, and fruit and vegetables were even more uncommon.
In response the nurses invited mothers to come after school on visiting
days to talk about food values, infant feeding and the care of sickly or
delicate children. In 1919 the Bush Nursing Association sent a submission
to the Education minister, stressing the importance of cookery and food
value lectures and lessons. This `health missioner' role of the nurse was
later extended through the infant welfare movement. Bush nurses were among
the first students at the infant welfare training school which opened at
South Melbourne in October 1920.
  After Mary Thompson's appointment early in 1911 Edith Barrett and Mrs
Lang, the Melbourne District Nursing Society's representatives on Council,
organized the purchase of the nurse's outfit which included a uniform and
bag of equipment. The dress was pale grey with a white apron, collar and
cuffs, and the only adornment was the badge pre+sented to each nurse at
her installation. Lady Dudley donated the cost of the badges, which had
been designed at her request by Miss Officer of the Arts and Crafts society.
They featured an enamelled green beech leaf recalling Beech Forest, and
the motto `By love serve one another'. When Lady Dudley died in July 1920
the presentation of badges ceased.
  A typical nurse's cap and veil of the period may have been issued for
indoor use, but riding habit and oilskins were usual wear during much of
the nurse's time on duty. Stout boots were essential. Nurse Tucker, who
succeeded Mary Thompson at Beech Forest, once walked eight kilo+metres in
three quarters of an hour on a call to a seriously ill patient in the bush.
After 1913 novices were given rudimentary instruction at a Melbourne riding
school on how to handle a horse. Advanced skills in riding or driving a
gig, however, came only from hard experience.
  At first most nurses carried their equipment in a portmanteau, al+though
Gunbower's nurse in 1913, Ida Crook, slung a kit-bag across her shoulders
and rode a pony called Natty. From the end of that year the kit included
two black leather saddlebags with VBNA stamped in letters half an inch high.
Packed in these or the portmanteau were waterproof sheeting, buttercloth,
absorbent wool, calico and strapping (which seems to have replaced formal
leg and arm splints). There were also rubber gloves, douche, enema, catheter,
bedpan, kidney dish, measure, invalid feeding equipment, lysol and sterilizing
tablets, eye dropper and drops, surgical needles, scissors, thread and forceps,
a thermometer, hot water bag, tongue depressor and simple ointments and
medicaments such as Vaseline, tannic and boracic acids, and castor and olive
oils. A medical relic of bygone days was the half pint pot of Prunier's brandy.
A hypodermic syringe with morphia and strychnine tablets was added in 1913
but the brandy stayed on the list. It was occasionally used as a stimulant.
A nail-brush and soft soap for cleansing, and an exercise book and temperature
charts for recording case histories completed the equipment.
  An order for sheets, pillow-cases, towels and a blanket was put through
in February 1911 but this seems to have been unique to Beech Forest and
was perhaps meant for use in the ambulance. Each nurse's outfit originally
cost about 12&pound;, and replacement of stores and chemist supplies quickly
mounted to more than 10&pound; a year. In May 1913 local committees were
made responsible for replacements of drugs, follow+ing, where possible,
the advice of the doctor whose help the nurse was likely to call on in serious
cases. The local `drug safe' administered by the bush nurse was to prove
of great benefit in isolated districts. The cost of the original kit items,
supplied out of central funds, rose by fifty per cent between 1913 and 1919.
  The nurse's salary remained at 135&pound; a year until late in 1919.
Out of this she paid her own board. The rise to 150&pound; was granted
partly because New South Wales bush nurses were being offered 170&pound;.
However, even before 1919 local committees in Victoria were asked to refund
the nurse any board costs over 35&pound; so that she could clear at least
100&pound;. Further adjustments came in September 1921 when the salary for
a nurse with just a midwifery certificate was set at 150&pound;, and for
a double certificated nurse 175&pound;. Centres with nurses in the latter
category were offered the alternative of providing free board and a 150&pound;
salary. Three weeks annual leave on full pay was standard from the beginning.
Costs of travel to and from a posting, and of all travel on duty were paid
by the local centre and were minimized by free passes for railway travel.
  For the first year or two recruitment of nurses was fairly easy but their
resignation rate was high. Most often the reason was marriage, as zest,
competence and compassion were undoubtedly attractive qualities.

<h> Sensitive massage </h>

<h>- PART 4
NECK AND SHOULDER MASSAGE </h>

<bl> By Ralph Hadden </bl>

  What with driving cars, long hours at an office desk and all the slings
and arrows of daily life, we all know neck and shoulder tension. As a
professional masseur I find that every one of my clients has experienced
tension there, and needs the relief of massage - massage to undo the knots,
relieve the tightness and pain, and loosen the locks.

<h> The Neck, Shoulders and Upper Back </h>

The neck and shoulder region is vital and central to the body's functioning.
The neck is the all-important link between the head and the body, mind and
feelings, major sense receptors and means of locomotion. We turn around
on our neck and upper back to point our major sense receptors towards what
interests us or, if we feel over-stimulated or overstressed, we create muscle
tension to resist move+ment and prevent ourselves from turning.
  The configuration of this region reflects our life history. Hunched
shoulders, for example, may indicate that this person, as a child, was
frequently hit by a parent and they may be hunched as if anticipat+ing
the next blow. If our life was very frightening we may pull the head back
in fear, using chronic tension in the neck to maintain our `safer' position,
or we may compensate by thrusting the head aggressively forwards. Someone
who is figuratively a `pain in the neck' - a nag+ging nuisance - may, if
we look into it, become literally a pain in the neck.
  Our shoulders and upper back are where we `shoulder our responsibilities'
and we may droop or sag or stiffen under these. Unexpressed anger and
frustration can also store in this region.
  When the area is functioning properly it is fully mobile, enabling full
expression of ourselves and flexible response to the world. Massage to this
area will help it to become free.


<h> The Massage </h>

This massage will follow the three-level pattern, as mentioned in the first
article in this series (Nature &amp; Health, Vol. 6, no.4). As I explained then,
massage is best done working progressively through three different levels
of pressure - surface stroking, intermediate level kneading, and deep pressure
- and should then be completed with soothing stroking again. We'll also
add some other strokes to round out the massage.
  In the other articles in the series I've described massage with the recipient
lying down, but this time we'll do it a different way - sitting up. Though
the recipient is not as relaxed in sitting as he or she might be lying down,
there are advantages to this sitting massage:

<misc> &bullet;It's easy to do in everyday situations 
  - office, living room or bus stop(!)
  - and no special equipment or setting up is required, just a chair </misc>

<misc> &bullet;No oil is required </misc>

<misc> &bullet;For someone not used to massage this is an easy way to introduce them
to the experience - they don't have to undress or lie down, and it's very
satisfying </misc>

  Before you try the techniques described below, first of all try massaging
your own neck and shoulder region - feel into the muscles and notice where
you feel tight and notice what feels good to do to yourself. This self-massage
is not only good for you, it also gives you an under+standing of what your
partner will feel when you apply massage.
  Remember that this part of the body can carry a lot of tension, so don't
aggra+vate that by massaging in an agitated or rushed manner. Take it slow
and steady.

<h> Preparation </h>

As usual with massage it is best, if possi+ble, to be in a quiet place without
distrac+tions, though this is not so crucial with the sitting massage.
  Have your partner sitting comfortably on a straight backed chair, without
arms (they get in the way) and with a firm seat (you don't want your partner
sagging as you press). Check whether your partner has any recent injuries
or problems that require careful attention.

<h> Beginning </h>

Consciously relax and settle yourself. Rest your hands on your partner's
shoul+ders (a good neutral point for making initial contact) and be still,
being aware of how your partner feels. Give a soothing stroking to the whole
area - upper back, shoulders, neck, head.

<h> Kneading </h>

Knead and squeeze the neck, shoulders and upper back with both hands. Aim
to grip a broad area of muscle each time, and apply the squeeze firmly and
slowly, and release it slowly.
  The area between the neck and shoul+der (the trapezius muscle) feels great
with this stroke, so give it a good squeeze, using two hands on the one
side (see fig.1).
  Now give a squeeze to the `shoulder pad' (deltoid muscle).
  On the upper back you can't grip much flesh, but just knead as much as
you can.
  Now work on the muscles at the back of the neck (again a much appreciated
stroke) by tilting the head slightly forward, steadying the forehead with one 
hand and squeezing as if gripping the scruff of the neck (as you would pick up
a puppy). (see fig. 2). Check that your partner feels comfortable with this
stroke.

<h> Deep Pressure </h>

With the thumb, or tips of the fingers, press into the soft tissue just
below the bony occipital ridge (base of skull) at the top of the spine,
and one or two inches either side (fig 3). Work only on the back of the
head and neck, not to the sides which are more vulnerable. On each point
press in slowly, hold, then slowly release - this should take about the
same amount of time as an out-breath. Con+tinue with deep pressure to work
on the muscles running beside the spine in the neck and upper back. Press
down on the muscles between neck and shoulder and into any other muscle
areas of the upper back as needed.
  
<h> SENSITIVE MASSAGE </h>

Be careful. The deep pressure work is most effective, but can also cause
harm if used inappropriately:

  <misc> &bullet; press only on soft tissue, not bone </misc>
<misc> &bullet; press and release slowly and steadily </misc>
<misc> &bullet; use a strong pressure, but only as strong as your partner is able to
    comfortably receive and stay relaxed with. If you feel your partner
    tensing up, ease off the pressure </misc>
<misc> &bullet; don't press on the sides of the neck, only on the muscles at the back
    running alongside the spine </misc> 
<misc> &bullet; keep the head and neck alligned in a normal, straight alignment. Apart
    from letting the head drop slightly forward while working on the base
    of the skull, do not twist, bend side+ways or rotate the head and neck </misc>

<h> Breathing </h>

Encourage your partner to breathe freely while you use the deep pressure.
If a point that you're pressing on feels sore, your partner can help to
release this by brea+thing out as you press, feeling that they're releasing
the tension as they do so.
 
<h> Soothing </h>

After the strong work you've just done, now we do some soothing massage
- some `sugar with the medicine' (but better for you than sugar!)
  Work your fingers in under the hair and massage the scalp, getting the scalp
to slide around slightly. Give a gentle upwards tug to the hair. (fig. 4).
Move to one arm, wrap your hands around the uppermost part of it, give a
slow firm squeeze, release, move down a few inches, squeeze and release
again, and so on, slowly squeezing and releasing down the arm, all the way
to the fingertips. Shake your hands loose, and repeat with the other arm.

<h> Finishing </h>

Stand in front of your partner and rest your hands lightly on his or her
head. Lightly and slowly brush your fingertips down the sides of the head,
onto the neck, shoulders, arms and hands, and sweep off the fingertips.
Shake your hands loose. Tell your partner to rest awhile.

<h> When to use this Massage </h>

Everybody will appreciate this massage but particularly those who are feeling
stressed in some way - frazzled by a hard day in the office, weary and tense
after many hours driving, or a parent who's fed up with the kids, for example.
Headaches can often be soothed away with this massage but be careful. If
the massage is done too strongly, too quickly or too roughly you can
make the headache worse. Check as you go along whether what you're
doing feels OK, and go slowly and calmly.
  When this massage is done well your friends will feel marvellous - it's
a great relief to have that tension massaged away, and the freedom of movement
and ease that results brings a contented smile to everyone's face.

<h> The Magnetic Factor, </h>

<bl> Christobel Munson </bl>

  What on earth has mag+netism to do with health? One concerns the physical,
fleshly body, nutrition, caring - the other is to do with iron, steel, electric
currents and magnetic fields. The two seem diametrically opposed, or so
I thought until I investigated further. For it seems that for centuries
man has observed a distinct reaction in the body to the pull of magnetism:
be it to the turning of the tides affected by the moon's magnetic pull or
simply the placing of magnets directly on injured parts of the body to speed
up healing.
  It turns out that the entire planet is under the influence of magnetism
- and we're all included in that. We talk of someone having `animal magnetism'
or charm, or `magnetic appeal' - a type of personal charisma. But there's
more to it than just a lure-of-the jungle vibra+tion. Doctors these days
are saying that some period problems in women may be caused by magnetic
field problems: apparently women with menstruation problems emit a highter
electric charge than others. With simple protoplasmic bodies, the immediate
effects as a result of contact with magnets are astounding and profound.
And with our bodies, the effects can be just as amazing.
  Considerable research has been done in the East, especially in Japan and
China, and also throughout Europe - especially in Austria, Ger+many and the
Scandinavian countries - concerning the effects of magnetic power on the
body. In the United States, orthopaedic surgeons have been experimenting
with inserting magnets into plaster casts to aid heal+ing. Here in Australia,
the biggest impact regarding health and mag+netism has, to date, been with
horses. Local trainers know well the extraordi+nary results of electro-magnetic
blan+kets on injured horses; electro-magne+tic paddles are held over fracture
sites to considerably aid healing and the union of bones. A magneto-pulse
is directed to the injured area at regular intervals and the horse can be
back in action in three weeks, not six, this way. This has been common knowledge
in the horse-training world for at least ten years.
  So if it works for horses - why not us?
  It does work. And it has been doing so all along. We just haven't been
into it for a few centuries. In prehistoric times in China, lode stones
made of magnetic material were used on acupuncture point sites, before there
was acapunc+ture. This aided the healing process. Egyptian priests investigated
and used magnetic fields for therapeutic use and other ancient physicians
such as Hip+pocrates, Paracelsus and Galen all in+vestigated the use of magnetic
energy in healing.
  According to one Sydney medical doctor specialising in acupuncture, the
power of magnetic fields was 're-disco+vered' by space scientists, both
Russian and American, when the first men in space suffered from the
weightlessness and the lack of gravity. What worked best to set them straight,
as it were, was magnetic-field therapy. This oriental doctor's main practice
is dealing with people with chronic degenerative heart disease, and people
often come to him when they've exhausted all other avenues of healing.
  `Many people come to me with low energy,' he told me. `They are depleted,
with chronic illness, post-glandular fever, post-hepatitis, and their healing
power is poor. And for them I use magnetic-field therapy. It's an ancient
treatment. Today, like many medical doctors, I investigate all kinds of
wholistic ways to heal.' Acupuncture and magnetic-field therapy are intertwined, he explained as magnetic-field therapy centres on stimulating the acupuncture points and meridians around the body to accelerate healing or pain relief.

<note> 2014 words </note>

  <h> The female body </h>

A woman is female from the moment she is conceived. This is determined by
the pattern of chromosomes (thread-like structures within each living cell
that contain genetic information) in the fertilized egg. Every woman has
23 pairs of chromosomes, 22 are the same as for men, but the 23rd pair is
different. It consists of two X-chromosomes. Men have one X- and one
Y-chromosome. The two X-chromosomes are responsible for ensuring the
development of internal and external genitals such as ovaries, fallopian
tubes, womb and vagina. Hormones secreted by the ovaries and other glands
during fetal growth are thought to affect the development of the brain and
its sense of being female.
  The feminine body shape is largely the result of the action of the sex
hormones oestrogen and progesterone, which are responsible for the development
of features known as secondary sexual characteristics - full, round and
mature breasts; rounded swelling hips; thighs well padded with fat; a
well-defined, curved waistline; absence of hair on the torso and face. Other
distinctly female characteristics include a relatively high-pitched voice
and a higher proportion of body fat. The rising and falling levels at which
oestrogen and progesterone are secreted by the ovaries, are also responsible
for the regular monthly changes that are known as the menstrual cycle (see
p.117).
  Because of differences between the physical and hormonal make-up of men and
women, there are small but important differences in the susceptibility of
each sex to certain disorders. The monthly bleeding experienced by women
means they suffer more often than men from anaemia (lack of sufficient red
blood cells). For reasons not yet understood fully, women seem to more susceptible
to liver damage from alcohol and so should drink less. On the positive side,
the female sex hormones may well provide extra protection against coronary
heart disease up until the menopause. Women generally live longer than men;
average life expectation is 76 for women, 70 for men. Some of these additional
years can be attributed to the fact that fewer women have traditionally
been smokers. The gap now seems to be narrowing - perhaps as a result of
the changes in women's lifestyle over the past few decades.

<h> The changing body </h>

Most body systems lose some efficiency as a result of the ageing process,
partly because specialist cells die and are not replaced, and partly because
tissues become less elastic and more fibrous. Loss of elasticity due to
age is most obvious in the skin, and this process may be accelerated by
excessive exposure to sunlight and by smoking. By the time a woman approaches
middle-age she tends to gain weight, and muscle tone may become more lax,
especially if she has not taken regular exercise. An unhealthy life style
- particularly lack of exercise and a poor diet - may exaggerate the physical
effects of ageing. The most significant milestone of the middle years is
the menapause (see p. 116), when a woman ceases to be fertile and menstruation
no longer occurs.
  Following the menopause the ageing process continues. One possible
development is a thinning of the bones, which may become brittle and easily
broken by minor falls. In later years, compression of the bones of the spine
can lead to loss of height, and there may be loss of weight due to wasting
of muscle. As the body ages it has fewer resources with which to withstand
periods of ill health, and the healing process of minor injuries slows down
considerably. Even so, if you take regular, vigorous exercise throughout
your life, you will be likely to have much the same body shape at 60 as
you have had at 30.

<h> Skeleton </h>

The bony skeleton provides the rigid structure that supports the muscles
and provides a protective framework for the organs. Female bones are generally
slightly lighter than a male's, and the pelvis wider in order to allow a
baby's head and body to pass during childbirth. Bone itself is made up of
a protein hardened with calcium salts. It is living material with cells
that are constantly replacing old bone with new material. To maintain healthy
bones, you need adequate amounts of protein, calcium and vitamins in your
diet.

<h> Muscles </h>

Movement of the body and its internal organs is carried out by the muscles.
These are made up of a soft tissue arranged in fibres which can contract
and relax to produce movement. There are two distinct types of muscle:
voluntary muscles, which control body movement, and involuntary muscles,
which are responsible for movement within the body - for example, the womb,
which expands to an enormous extent during pregnancy.
  Muscles normally remain in good condition if used regularly. Vigorous
exercise increases the size of muscles and improves the circulation of blood
to them, thereby increasing their capacity for still more strenuous activity.
Conversely, inactivity can soon lead to muscle-wasting and weakness.

<h> Respiratory system </h>

Respiration - inhaling (breathing in) and exhaling (breathing out) air -
allows the blood to absorb oxygen essential for the production of energy.
As the blood passes through the lungs it gives off carbon dioxide and water
as waste products.
  The respiratory system consists of the lungs and tubes through which air
passes on its way to and from the lungs. Air is breathed in through the
nose and mouth, passes down the trachea (windpipe) and enters the lungs
through a branching tree of tubes - the bronchi and bronchioles.
  The respiratory system normally remains in good health unless damaged by repeated
exposure to pollutants in the atmosphere, including dust from industrial
or agricultural processes and tobacco smoke, or by repeated infection.

<h> Fat distribution </h>

Fat is deposited in a layer under the skin and within the tissues in other
parts of the body including the buttocks, breasts and inside the abdominal
cavity. It makes up 20 to 25 per cent of a woman's weight (compared with
15 per cent of a man's) and is distributed in such a way as to give a woman's
body its characteristic contours. Fat is laid down when food intake is greater
than is needed to fuel the body's energy requirements. It is burnt up when
food intake fails to meet the body's need. It also acts as insulation against
cold.
  Both too much and too little fat in the body can be unhealthy. Being too
fat can lead to heart and circulation problems. Being too thin is less of
a health risk, but may be a sign of undernourishment and can lead to reduced
resistance to a variety of diseases. Fluctuations in the level of fat deposits
is almost always the result of an imbalance between food intake and energy
output.

<h> Heart and circulation </h>

The heart is a muscular pump with four chambers into which enter the major
blood vessels carrying blood to and from the rest of the body. As the heart
rhythmically squeezes the chambers, making them expand and contract, blood
flows in the correct direction.
  Blood transports oxygen and nutrients (see Blood analysis, p. 22) to all
parts of the body and carries away waste products. It circulates via the
arteries, which carry "used" blood. Good blood circulation, essential for
the health of every organ in the body, depends on the efficient functioning
of the heart muscle and partly on the ease of blood flow through the arteries.
  It also depends on the blood vessels remaining free from any obstruction,
such as fatty deposits*desposits or blood clots. High blood pressure (hypertension)
may damage the blood vessels or increase the risk of blockage of the blood
vessels. For advice on reducing the risks of diseases of the heart and
circulation, see Coronary heart disease, p. 100.
  Women under the age of 50 are relatively free from coronary heart disease.
This is thought to be partly due to larger amounts of the hormones progesterone
and oestrogen being present in the body. 

<h> The circulatory system </h>

The circulatory system carries blood to and from every part of the body.
The centre of the system is the heart. Arteries carry blood away from the
heart; veins return blood to the heart.

<h> Arteries and veins </h>

The walls of arteries need to be strong, because blood is forced along them
under high pressure, so they are made of four layers. Arteries and their
various branches (arterioles) are surrounded by muscle which allows them
to dilate or contract to regulate the body temperature. Veins have less
elastic, less muscular walls. Valves in the veins stop blood from flowing
in the wrong direction.

<h> Heart vessels </h>

The heart is divided into two by the septa. Each side has two chambers -
an atrium, and a ventricle - linked by a one-way valve. The left atrium
and ventricle control oxygenated blood, and those on the right de-oxygenated
("used") blood. The septa prevents the two types of blood from mixing.

<h> Brain and nervous system </h>

The brain and nervous system together provide the control mechanism for both
conscious activities, such as thought and movement, and for unconscious
body functions such as breathing and digestion. Nerves also provide the
means by which we register sensations such as pain and temperature.
  The brain and nervous system require a constant supply of oxygenated blood.
Disruption of the blood flow to any part of the system is one of the most
common causes of malfunctioning of the brain and nervous system. Therefore,
the prevention of circulatory trouble (see left) is important. Injury,
infection, degeneration, tumours and diseases of unknown cause may also
affect the brain and nervous system. Certain disorders may arise out of
abnormal electrical activity or chemical imbalances in the brain.

<h> The nervous system </h>

The brain and the nerve tracts of the spinal cord together make up the central
nervous system. A network of peripheral nerves, which are named after the
four regions of the spine, link the central system with other parts of the
body.

<h> The brain </h>

The brain itself is the most complex organ in the body; many aspects of
its structure and function are not yet fully understood. Different parts
of the brain seem to control different activities. The two cerebral hemispheres
control conscious thought and movement, and interpret signals from the sensory
organs. The cerebellum regulates some subconscious activities such as
coordination of movement and balance. The brain stem governs vital body
functions such as heartbeat and breathing.

<h> The senses </h>

The senses are the means by which we monitor the different aspects of our
environment. Five separate systems respond to different types of physical
stimuli: the eyes enable us to interpret visual information; the ears monitor
sound and control balance; the nose and tongue respond to different smells
and tastes respectively; and the sensory neves in the skin allow us to feel
physical contact (touch), changes in temperature, and pain.

<h> Smell </h>

Smells are detected by the olfactory nerves. These hair-like organs project
into the top of the nasal cavity and absorb and analyse molecules from the
breathed-in air. The sense of smell may be damaged by smoking and may
temporarily be impaired by a common cold or hayfever. Permanent loss of
the sense of smell may occur following damage to the nerves, perhaps as a
result of a skull injury, or it may be caused by a disorder affecting the
part of the brain responsible for interpreting smell sensations.

<h> Taste </h>

The main taste organs are the taste buds. These are located in hair-like
papillae that project from the upper surface of the tongue. They can
distinguish only four basic tastes: sweet, sour, salt and bitter. The taste
buds for each taste are located in a different area of the tongue. The sense
of taste is closely allied to the sense of smell, which helps us to
differentiate a greater range of flavours. Loss of the sense of smell is
the usual cause of impairment to the sense of taste, but certain drugs and
occasionally zinc deficiency may also have the same effect.

<h> Touch </h>

The sense of touch, which includes all skin sensations, is conveyed through
the nerves from the sense receptors that lie under the surface of the skin.

<h> Nutritious foods and drinks </h>

<bl> By Demeter Hillman </bl>

  Travel in the past used to be an experience with stimulating, surprising
experiences of distinctive archi+tecture, customs, food and drink. Travel
in our modern age, with mass transport, to well advertised destina+tions,
either on holiday or to cities, means experiencing the uniformity of western
civilisation in its various forms and climates, depending upon the Continent.
We are then persuaded that mass catering and processed foods and drinks
are to our benefit. Distinctions and distinctiveness have almost totally
been sacrificed to ambitions that serve a mass market.
  Many traditional foods and drinks with valuable health properties are
now almost unobtainable and finding an unpolluted area that has not been
saturated with mass travel, a beauty spot not spoilt, can be a problem unless
one is prepared to go some distance to maintain individuality.
  Growing economic problems for rural populations and the increasing influence
of technology have for many areas increased the plight of how to remain
self sufficient. Changing world influence, world markets and world tension
have created new population pat+terns, but in most instances a flight from
the land for an uprooted and unprotected rural population is a common fate.
With such uprooting much simple, but valuable knowledge and practices,
traditional food preparation, are lost. Such sad patterns have been experienced
for hundreds of years, but our age has accelerated this destructive process
and put nothing in its place.

<h> Creating Tranquility </h>

  The only compensation would be to once again create  conditions favourable
towards a return of an unhurried, unstressed way of life, in chosen rural
areas with pro+grams for their restoration, without pollution and any violent
technology with an emphhasis on biological needs first, and in housing,
to be able to build bio+houses without health hazards.
  Creating tranquil, unpolluted islands where the health of future generations
may be safeguarded is a priority in all countries because of the encroaching
adverse effects of what a violent technology already has created, threatening
the very existence of life on this planet. That is why the study of a
non-violent, advan+ced biology and ecology with a new awareness of past
and present should be a new priority.
  Also biological clothing is important in order to over+come the ever
increasing allergies and multiple allergies caused by many thousands of
chemicals everywhere in our environment near and far.
  Study of traditional food and drinks that have pro+phylactic properties
can be rewarding, also when it can be combined with reading books on travel
in the past, when it was still adventurous and hazardous and took perhaps
many weeks or even months to make progress across one Continent.

<h> Handing On Traditions </h>

  In remote areas of various countries one can still be assured of traditional
customs having kept their place, where people in rural areas are still able
to follow their natural life styles.
  Although in many areas in remote country regions the diet may have been
rather monotonous, in order to ensure survival, traditional knowledge on
how to pre+pare fermented foods would be passed on to the next generation
without question. Fermented foods ensured immunity against some illnesses
that threatened because of an absence of hygiene, but fermented foods and
drinks also ensured that hardships resulting from weather changes and exposure
to the elements need not be injurious to health.
  Plain foods were made piquant by means of the micro-organisms developing
in fermented foods and drinks, thereby enhancing or ennobling the foods
by increasing their food value.
  In recent centuries meat consumption has increased five fold and it has
become a symbol of affluence; its modern production has caused many new
health hazards, from hormones, antibiotics, implants of peni+cillin and
so on.
  In past centuries in some remote areas, potatoes and grains accounted
for 60%-80% of food by weight. This meant that ingenious preparation and
methods of serving, additions of herbs and spices, would provide stimulation,
together with the addition of some other vegetables.
  Until about 300 years ago, bread was baked by the sourdough fermentation
method and provided some of the necessary lactic acid, as did the traditional
drinks with health giving properties. In our modern foods we may find many
new ingredients that render the food sterile instead of keeping it full
of living micro-organ+isms to enhance the body's resistance to ill health.
  However, not all travellers in the past were prepared for what they found,
nor did they appreciate it. "The bread was normally black rye bread", an
English writer, travelling in Russia in the 1840s complained: "They ferment
their bread to the third or acetous degree; the black bread, unlike that
of all other coun+tries, is bitter and sour, and as nauseous in the mouth
as alum." Others argued that Russian workers showed sound nutritional judgment
in preferring a bread that was well fermented and as heavy as possible,
the lactic acid which made bread sour was a vital dietary supplement and
its heaviness was also valued.

<h> Solid Food </h>

  "Solid" (Prochnyi) food is food which is both nour+ishing and slow to digest,
which remains in the stomach for a long time, for once your belly is empty
you can no longer do heavy work until you eat again.
  As black rye bread is the main component of the diet, it is important
that the bread should be thick, not light, not doughy, and made well, out
of fresh flour. A worker pays great attention to bread. Good bread is the
most important thing.
  More observations about Russian food are that mushrooms and sorrel may
also be "soured in", like white cabbage. "Pickled cabbage (Parkinson's
`saurk+raut') was a universal staple in Great Russia. "Pick+led vegetables
may have provided a valuable anti+scorbutic. Certainly peasants generally
attributed great importance to the presence of something sour in the diet."
  "For the peasants, something acidic (kislota) is an essential part of
any diet."
  The rural population in Russia in particular relies on having for their
meals regular supplies of pickled cabbage, pickled beetroot, mushrooms,
gherkins, or, in the absence of such soured vegetables, whey or butter+milk
to add to soups made with fresh vegetables. Also the best known Russian
drink, Kvass, may be added to soup, or fermented dough, in order to supply
the acidity that is appreciated for its energy giving qualities.
  Kvass was an essential for preventing infectious diseases and epidemics
also an antidote to scurvy in country regions where hygienic arrangements
were absent. Kvass or quass was also a nutritious drink, however, and
making Kvass was a basic skill acquired that was as important as making
bread, as both were equally important in daily life. Kvass could be made
with barley, rye, wheat, buckwheat or oats, to which fruit juices were added.
Among the fruit Kvasses there could be additions of pears, cherries, lemons,
berries, herbs, apples, etc., whatever could be found in the countryside
and was easily available from the natural environment. 
  Another traditional drink is Kaffir beer, the national beverage of the Bantu
tribes of South Africa. Kaffir beer is characterised by the fermenting of 
previously soured gruel, generally prepared from ground malted and unmalted 
Sorghum. "A great variety of similar beverages is still prepared today by the 
natives through+out Africa from indigenous cereals, and Kaffir beer from 
Southern Africa is quite comparable with `mer+issa' from the Sudan, `bouza' 
from Ethiopia and `pombe' from East Africa," writes J.P. Van der Walt in 
Kaffircorn Malting and Brewing Studies II. Studies on the Microbiology of 
Kaffir Beer. The Kaffir beer is rich in lactic acid and vitamins such as 
Thiamine, Ribo+flavin, Nicotinic acid, also in fibre and protein, etc., 
provided the original fermenting process is retained, home brewing guarantees 
high nutritional value.

<h> Modern Diet Deficient </h>

  Our present "civilisation diet" which has relied more and more on convenience
foods and luxury foods from supermarkets during past decades is sadly lacking
in enzymes, as fresh vegetables are almost unobtainable to the city dwellers,
as it may take two days for them to be delivered from the country through
the commercial channels.
  Also the contamination of many foods with PCP and PCB has caused many
new outbreaks of "allergy" diseases as well as multiple allergies. Coeliac
disease, caused by malfunction or breakdown of the pancreas gland, is a
frequent and growing complaint now. 
  Dr. A. Vogel, the famous Swiss Nature Doctor, who also produces more than
3,000 homoeopathic medi+cines in his Bioforce Laboratory, mentions that there
are dozens of Lady's Bedstraw plants and that all of them have the strange
property of coagulating milk, like rennet obtained from calf's stomachs.
This juice in the plant makes it suitable for producing cheeses.
(Lab-Labferment). 
  It is in particular this biological combination, besides other mineral
constituents that are in the Lady's Bedstraw plants, that has an excellent
effect upon the pancreas gland. It is known that the pancreas gland has
a double function. The external secretion excretes enzymes, amylase in
particular. This has the effect in the small intestine of changing carbohydrate
into sugar, i.e. digesting cereals, potatoes or any other starch; it is
this starch that is digested by the enzyme, provided the cereal grains have
been broken down first.
  Hence, if there are problems with the digestion of carbohydrate, if
fermentations and flatulence become a problem in that the transformation
of the starch into a sugar form is not working properly, then Lady's Bed+straw
is the correct treatment in order to stimulate and support the malfunctioning
of the pancreas gland. It ought to be used freshly gathered when blooming
between June and August, otherwise dried as infusion, to make a tea. Two
teaspoons fresh or one teaspoon dried herbs are enough for half a litre.
  Lady's Bedstraw also has an intensely stimulating effect upon the kidneys,
this can be further enhanced by adding Solidago, about 30-50 drops. It is best
drunk in the morning. One will be able to observe that this has a diuretic
effect during the day. Drinking this tea during the afternoon would tend
to disturb the night's rest. Lady's Bedstraw also contains bitter substances
that provide a supporting effect in every cancer therapy.
 
<h> Anti-cancerous Effect </h>

  "Whether it is the bitter substances that aid cancer therapies it is
difficult to say," says Dr. Vogel. It has been observed, however, that there
are surprising experiences when Lady's Bedstraw is employed in cancer therapy.
 Mrs. Marie Treben has reported that Lady's Bed+straw may produce surprising
results when used in cancer therapy, as this plant has made a considerable
contribution during external as well as internal applica+tions or
administrations, i.e. during treatment of various cancer tumours, as well
as during treatment of cancer-like skin diseases. "One should, of course,
not merely rely on the effects of one single plant but ought to observe
the principles of holistic therapy when there are serious diseases to be
treated, such as the pancreas gland or cancer," says Dr. Vogel. Nutritional
principles as well as all other healing factors that support, which strengthen
and re-activate the regeneration powers of the body and support it, are
to be considered. "If Lady's Bedstraw was taken as a prophylactic, this too,
would not ignore the many sided good properties of this healing plant, and
could prevent many unnecessary illnesses."
  When foods are fermented they unlock additional nutritional factors that
have health enhancing proper+ties. This is the case also for ancient,
traditional drinks, many of which have been sacrificed to the development
of civilisation and have been forced to make way for more artificial drinks
produced commercially that do not have these prophylactic and nutritious 
properties. Wherever the natural rural life has had to make way for industrial
life with all its disadvantages and commer+cialisation, the enslaving of 
women into factory work and the displacement of a rural natural rhythm for a 
stress filled life, there the natural raw materials are less easily accessible
and home brewing is displaced by the commercial brewing of traditional 
nutritious drinks.
  Where traditional drinks were based upon a thick gruel that was fermented
into an opaque drink with suspended particles, where this drink acted not
merely as an energy drink but also as a food, supplying many nutriments,
we find that some adulteration or mass-production without basic ingredients
may lead to mal+nutrition as a natural outcome in the native population.

<h> The villa in Australia </h>

<bl> By Clive Lucas </bl>

<misc> Clive Lucas OBE, FRAIA, is principal of Clive Lucas &amp; Partners, architects,
Sydney, and has been responsible for the restoration of a number of the
villas discussed in this article </misc>

`Villa', to most readers, probably con+jures up the suburban detached or
semi-detached houses of late Victorian and Edwardian Australian cities.
But this ar+ticle deals with the period before c1860, before the eighteenth
century sense of the word, villa, `was vulgarised' to quote Dr Mark Girouard.
  In 1827 James Elmes in his Metropolitan Improvements described the villa
thus:

The Villa (as distinct from the mansion), is the mere personal property
and residence of the owner, where he retires to enjoy himself without state.
It is superior to the ornamented cottage, standing, as it were between the
cottage ornee of the French, and the mansion or hall of the English.
  The term is never more properly applied than when given to such suburban
structures as those that are rising around us, serving as they may well
do from situation as to the town, and from position as to rural beauty.

  Later in 1833 the influential architec+tural writer J.C. Loudon defined
it in his Encyclopaedia of Cottage, Farm and Villa Architecture as `a
gentleman's residence in the country ... a place of agreeable re+tirement',
a house to `be situated if pos+sible, in a beautiful country, within reach
of a public road, and at an easy distance from the metropolis ... the principal
front as to be seen from the public road, and to command a beautiful and
exten+sive prospect over a fertile country; hav+ing in the middle distance
a town or village, with its "heaven-direct spire".
  It was, as Elmes said, a house which stood somewhere between the cottage
and the mansion. It was the abode, es+sentially, of someone who made his
liveli+hood elsewhere and, in the nineteenth century, someone who made his
living in the town, a member of the growing professional and mercantile
classes who proliferated in the nineteenth century.
  Loudon suggested such a house as a retreat and recommended it being `about
ninety miles, or a day's journey, from the metropolis', but it was also
suburban, a place where the merchant or professional lived outside the
immediate town, a house set in its own grounds of several acres with pleasure
garden, vegetable garden, orchard and stabling.
  The other thing that the villa had was style or, if you like, architectural
preten+tiousness, as a glance through the many architectural pattern books,
which abounded in early nineteenth century England, or in Loudon's
Encyclopaedia it+self, will prove.
  London's book has, amongst others, designs for a:
<misc> &bullet;Grecian Villa of a medium size, for a Gentleman of Fortune </misc>
<misc> &bullet;Suburban Villa of Two Acres and a half </misc>
<misc> &bullet;Villa in the Anglo-Italian Style </misc>

<misc>&bullet;A Villa in the Old Scotch Style. </misc>
Similarly, many of the pattern books included designs for villas. Examples
are -
  <misc> Designs for Elegant Cottages and Small Villas, 1806, by Edward Gyfford
  Hints for Dwellings consisting of Original Designs for Cottages, Farm
Houses and Villas, 1800, by David Laing </misc>
<misc> Architectural Designs for Rustic Cottages, Picturesque Dwellings, Villas
&amp;c., 1807 by William Pocock </misc>
<misc> Rural Residences consisting of a Series of Designs for Cottages, Decorated

Villas, 1798, by John Soane or Designs from the Simple Cottage to the Decorated
Villa, 1802, by John Plaw. </misc>
The prerequisites of a villa were that it be elegant, have style and be
an orna+ment to the landscape.
  In early nineteenth century Australia all houses with pretensions to style
were, in effect, villas whether they be subur+ban, in reach of the town,
or well into the country as homesteads on stations of thousands of acres.
In this sense they were quite unlike English villas which were rural retreats
rather than the prin+cipal seat of a landed proprietor. The decorated villa
was the best the colonial gentlemanly settler could aspire to as, de+spite
the rural wealth of the place, noth+ing was built which can be described
as a mansion or hall in the English sense of the word. Gentlemen here either
lived in bungalows as the vernacular verandahed cottage really was, or in
villas. It was a matter of style. Wherever such houses were built, their
designs were either taken from pattern books or were de+signed by local
architects.
  The beau ideal of a villa in Australia, to use Loudon's term, is perhaps
Rosedale in Tasmania, named for the Yorkshire valley from whence its proprietor
came. The house has style (Italian), and it ornaments the landscape set
against hills with the view from its terrace over fertile country and river.
As a contemporary traveller noted `Mr. Blackburn (an architect of this Colony)
has from a plain cottage converted it into a beautiful villa in the Italian
style'. James Blackburn designed this villa in 1847.
  On the Goulburn Plains, in the Country of Argyle in NSW - again on a large
sheep station - landed proprietor William Faithfull, built a villa in 1858.
`A suburban villa, with the House in the Italian Style' taken from Loudon's
The Suburban Gardener and Villa Companion, 1838. This design had first appeared
in Loudon's Architectural Magazine in 1836.
  By 1860 `villas' were in effect scattered across the settled areas of
Australia. Notable examples are Aberglasslyn at Maitland with its contained
villa plan; Panshanger in northern Tasmania with its chaste Grecian facade;
Killymoon, Fingal, Tasmania, with its geometrical preoccupation and its
basement offices is the contained villa in the round, as is Clarendon and
this makes them more in the mode of the English suburban villa than remote
country houses.
  The villa probably made its first ap+pearance with the appointment of
Gover+nor Lachlan Macquarie in 1809. The first houses with architectural
preten+sions were built at the instigation of the Governor and his wife.
Mrs Macquarie, who considered herself an architectural patron, brought with
her a library of books including the 1806 Gyfford's Hints for Elegant Cottages
and Small Villas from which she chose `Design the First' and `Design the
Second' for two ornamental civil servants' houses built in 1813 in Bridge
Street, Sydney, just outside the gates to Government House. These were
probably Australia's first villas.
  Other designs influenced by pattern books were John Macarthur's proposals
for his Pyrmont estate. Here the design, a Grecian villa, is Plate XXIV
from Soane's Sketches in Architecture of 1798.
  The colonial estate agents soon took up the term `villa' and, then as
now, probably incorrectly applied it. In June 1815 we read `to be let ...
the beautiful Villa and Demesne of Vaucluse' adver+tised in the Sydney Gazette.
This was well before W.C. Wentworth had given that house style and created
the gothic en+semble we know today. Vaucluse was, in 1837, correctly described
as `Mr. Went+worth's charming villa, of classic nomen+clature',  whereas in
1815 it was probably only a cottage, perhaps a deco+rated one, overlooking
Sydney harbour.
  The agent was perhaps correct in other respects; Vaucluse was the residence
of a gentleman (it had been let to Colonel O'Connell, later Sir Maurice
O'Connell, as a country retreat); it was beautifully sited in its own domain
and was within reach of the town.
  Sydney Harbour was a splendid place for building villas for gentlemen. Its
many inlets provided wonderful sites within reach of Sydney for the merchants
and professional men of the town.
  Henrietta Villa, an early substantial villa which adorned the harbourscape,
built in 1819 in the neoclassical style, was decribed as both a naval and
a marine villa.                                                
  Further up the harbour on Darling Point was a Gothic villa - our first
in this style - built in 1834 for the colonial treasurer, a Scotsman of
aristocratic lin+eage and connection. It was a villa in the round, with
basement offices, con+structed by local architects but, most scholars claim,
heavily influenced by a Loudon design `A villa in the Old Scotch Style'.
Agents must again take criticism for their imprecise terminology, for in
June 1841, when Lindesay was first up for sale, it was described as a `Mansion,
built substantially of stone in the Gothic style with grounds attached ...'
  Perhaps largest of all colonial houses, but contemporanously with its
construc+tion described as a villa, was the colonial secretary's house at
Elizabeth Bay `the place is now granted to Mr. Macleay who has converted
it into an excellent garden with a prospect of creating a Grecian Villa
contiguous'.
  As well as the harbour itself, there are numerous inlets along the coast
that provide suitable sites for villas. One such site was at Nelson's Bay
overlooking the sea where, in the early 1840s, an intellec+tual barrister
and his singular wife built a villa in the cottage style. Robert Lowe was
Oxford educated and his wife, Georgiana, came of an English landed family,
so it is perhaps not surprising that they created one of the most pic+turesque
and Elysian of all retreats. A villa needed educated and informed taste.
  The 1820s, 1830s and 1840s were the heyday of the villa. Several of the
subur+ban villas of Woolloomooloo Hill were designed by local architect
John Verge; one, Rockwall, the agents described in 1837 as `that splendid
Italian Villa' and at Harrington Park, Glenlee, and Wiven+hoe houses
which relate closely to the concept of a villa are to be found. Cam+den
Park itself, with its extensive pros+pect over a fertile country, and in
the middle distance a town with its `heaven-directing spire' must in NSW
come closest to the Loudon beau ideal laid down in his Encyclopaedia -
except in the mat+ter of style. Loudon felt the old English style was right
`in that ornate manner of it called the Elizabethan'. Camden was classical,
but then it was New South Wales.
  However, other proprietors, who did not have the wherewithall to create
a set+ting like the Macarthurs at Camden, took Loudon's advice on style
more lit+erally. One such man was the surveyor-general, Sir Thomas Mitchell,
who selected a `villa in the Old English man+ner' from Loudon as the design
for his harbourside villa, Carthona. For his country retreat within ninety
miles of Sydney, in 1847 he chose a `Villa in the Cottage Style', a Gothic
design from an 1835 pattern book of Rural Architecture by Francis Goodwin.
  From the late 1840s the idea of the villa seemed to wane, the term became
vulgarised as Girouard has said, and was not used by gentlemen. The term
con+tinued to be used by agents, but it was applied to town cottages, farm
houses and buildings which had no pretensions to style, nor as the residences
of gentle+men. Richmond Villa, Rosa Villa, Pen+rose Villa, Hampton Villa
and such names proliferated right through Vic+toria's reign and into the
Edwardian period.
  It is interesting to note that Verge, who of all colonial architects is
respon+sible for so many `villa designs', never seems to have used the term.
His ledger contains references to houses and cot+tages, but not villas,
even though many of his cottage designs were for gentlemen and were highly
finished and well placed. Houses like Bedervale, Wyoming and Rose Bay were,
to Verge, cottages. Even the highly decorated Tempe, which can surely
be termed a `Villa in the Cottage Style', Verge simply called `a cottage
at Tempe'.
  In the Australasian Sporting Magazine of November 1850 the following, which
is an interesting closing note to the story of the villa in Australia,
appeared:

Tempe this delightful*delightfull villa residence ... the seat of A.B. Sparke, Esq.,
is situated on the western bank of the river named after the immortal martyr
of Ohwiee, Captain Cook. Selected originally as a retreat from the cares
of business, yet, within easy distance of the town, the spot formerly displayed
all those wild features of the unbroken interior, which yielded indescribable
charms to the seeker after the tranquility of romantic retirement.

<h> How It Began: In General Practice </h>

  The town of Burraga will face epidemics, bushfires, floods, visits by
  bikies and exploitation by land developers. The farms around will be attacked
  by disease, the animals savaged by wild dogs, the crops fail in the drought.
  There will be football matches, cricket matches, `Burraga Show', fashion
  parades and the Annual Ball. Romances will form, marriages will break up,
  babies will be born and old people die. Some young people will die too,
  by disease, by accident, by their own hand.
    Our cast will be heavily involved in this cycle of life, with the town
  and with each other.
    The audience will be involved along with them.

                      <misc> James Davern's note to In General Practice </misc>

By July 1986, when this book appears, 420 episodes of A Country Practice
will have gone to air since it began in 1981. The program is the most popular
drama serial on Australian television, and is seen on nearly a hundred stations
across the country. Its ratings in Sydney and elsewhere are consistently
in the 30s, a figure that indicates in Sydney alone an audience of over
a million people. The marriage in 1983 of two of the central characters,
Vicky and Simon, drew a rating of 45 in Sydney (about one and a half million
people), and then a 46 rating in Brisbane (half a million people) for the
same episode. On the estimate that in 1982 each Sydney rating point was worth
about $2 million to Channel 7 over the year, ACP, `consistently rating over
30 in Sydney' for all of that year, was a valuable product for its host
company.
  ACP receives over a thousand fan letters a week; the one quoted below
is typical.

  My most deliberate and hearty congratulations for a powerful two nights'
  entertainment ... I have been meaning to write to you from the first time
  that I viewed A Country Practice. Last night forced me to. Fan-bloody-tastic.
  The whole production side and scripts, acting and directing is of the highest
  excellence. For the first time whilst watching an Australian show I was moved
  from anger through fright to near tears for the fate of the Matron and
  the outcome of Gus' situation. Brilliance and many more words for this
  man's performance. And also for everyone else in the principal cast ...
  No longer need Australian audiences have their intelligence insulted.
  For this I thank all involved in and with JNP.

  The show has a national fan club. One of its animal characters, Molly
Jones' pig Doris, was a guest of honour at Sydney and Adelaide agricultural
shows, and Simon's pet wombat Fatso has appeared on a children's calendar.
Newspapers and magazines run features on the program - on the cast, sometimes
on the crew, and on what may happen in future episodes. TV current affairs
host, Mike Willesee, produced a documentary feature which was shown in 
prime time to excellent ratings. A record of Vicky's and Simon's wedding
vows went into the Top Twenty.
  ACP is also shown outside Australia. In Britain it is shown on the ITV
network, and in London, playing on Wednesday afternoons, it has healthy
ratings of 16. An English fan writes: `The folk in Country Practice seem
more English than we are.' Today 458 episodes have been sold to Italy. It
is seen in Eire, on West German cable television, on the European satellite
system Sky TV, and in the USA. It is also seen in Zimbabwe, Zambia, Malta
and Hong Kong. James Davern, the executive producer, estimates that ACP's
worldwide audience is probably between five and six million people.
  ACP has become such an institution in Australian TV drama, that it's hard
to remember life before ACP began. Yet in tracing its history, we discover
how much its originality is a negotiation of past histories - of soap opera,
past program successes and failures, past station policies and past work
histories.

<h> Soap Opera </h>

Soap opera, or `women's weepies' began in the 1930s on American radio. The
form was both new and old. The serials were commissioned by radio stations
keen to fill daytime hours with material that would attract audiences, and
therefore advertisers. Large soap powder manufacturers were eager and willing
to pay to reach housewives, and romantic drama, drama of the `heart' and
the `emotions' was the dramatic vehicle chosen. Thus soap opera was born.
  Despite its poor critical reputation - one, incidentally, with which we
would not necessarily agree - soap opera obviously offers its audiences
considerable pleasure. They get to `know' the characters, the kinds of stories,
and issues that will develop. The regular viewer builds up a bank of
information in relation to a serial and the producers can take this for
granted. Thus a soap opera works in terms of an aesthetic shorthand, where
past events are briefly summarised, where a character can be recalled in
a word or sentence and the audience knows what is being alluded to. As one
of the writers on A Country Practice, David Boutland, put it:

  Television isolates people from each other. These characters become their
  friends. A lot of people are a lot happier watching Vicky be Vicky, Simon
  be Simon and predictably Dr Elliott being Dr Elliott, than having to deal
  with real people who are an unknown quantity. It's an easier thing. There's
  certainly something to be said for characters acting the way we know they'll
  act.

At the same time the soap opera, with its cliff-hanging endings, obviously
seeks to develop viewing habits. One episode sets up the need to find out
what happens next. The audience regards the main characters as friends,
and wants to go on meeting them. The satisfaction of curiosity in one episode
and the expectation of pleasure in succeeding ones leads the audience to
watch night after night, from one week to the next. The casual viewer becomes
a regular, and a fan is born.

<h> The Australian Soap </h>

The drama serial, soap opera, has been around in Australian broadcasting
for a very long time. One of the most durable radio examples, The Lawsons,
began on the ABC in 1944 and, changing its title to Blue Hills in 1949,
continued on air until 1976. Like ACP, Blue Hills was set in the country
and also contained an educational edge, although, like The Archers in Britain,
agricultural rather than medical or social. Although Blue Hills had a large
following in the city, the program was broadcast at 1 pm each day, to coincide
with rural audiences' lunch hour, and repeated early in the evening.
  Serial drama has been a feature of Australian television almost since
TV was established in 1956. Until the 1970s there was a good deal of
uncertainty about the audiences and timeslots for soaps. The history of
Australian television serials falls into three phases. The first, part of
an era often called `radio with pictures', was a direct attempt to transfer
the form from radio to television. The first actual serial, Autumn Affair
(1959), was produced by ATN Channel 7 in Sydney as a series of quarter-hour
episodes, intended mainly for women. It went to air each morning, immediately
after a breakfast show. However it had no luck, finding neither a sponsor
nor an audience.
  The second effort was directly instigated by the success of both Granada's
Coronation Street and Associated Television's Crossroads on British commercial
television in the early 1960s. The ABC's Bellbird, which was to run for
ten years, began in 1967. Like Coronation Street, Bellbird emphasised the
social interaction of a group of ordinary people. James Davern, who directed
the pilot episode, described the characters as `normal Australians living
in a country town'. Like Blue Hills, Bellbird was broadcast in quarter-hour
episodes at tea time each week day evening. It was very successful and built
up a solid audience.
  Crossroads had an Australian imitator in ATN 7's Motel. In a setting on
the road between Canberra and Sydney, Motel was directed mainly toward women
at home. It was thought, however, that in due course it might attract a
night time male audience as well; it was shown both at lunchtime and in
a late evening timeslot. Motel, however, failed to attract that larger
audience, and ceased production after more than 150 episodes.
  Australian commercial television drama at this time was dominated by the
Crawford police series. It was only with the 1972 success of Number 96 on
the 0-10 network that the drama serial became a viable programming form.
Number 96 chronicled the bawdy, comic and melodramatic lives of an amorphous
group of people sharing an apartment block in an inner Sydney suburb. Shown
in half-hour episodes five evenings a week in an adult time slot, 8.30 p.m.,
the program was enormously popular for much of its six years on air. Number
96 made the breakthrough. With the single exception of the Grundy
Organization's serial Until Tomorrow (1974/75) all Australian TV serials
produced since then have been designed to capture the large prime time evening
audience. 
  Since the early 1970s the soaps have proliferated: Certain Women, The
Box, The Sullivans, The Young Doctors, Cop Shop, The Restless Years, Prisoner,
Skyways, A Country Practice, Sons and Daughters, Carson's Law and Prime
Time. Other dramatic forms, like the play and the single-episode series,
have almost disappeared from commercial television. But it is important to
distinguish, within this successful group, between those that are strictly
continuous (The Young Doctors, The Sullivans and Sons and Daughters, for
instance) and those which are organised on the principle of the two-episode
block (Cop Shop, A Country Practice and Carson's Law). In the former time
is continuous from one episode to the next. In the latter group, time between
blocks is usually unspecified. This has consequences for showing repeats
of the two kinds of serials. Blocks can be repeated out of strict sequence.
Thus, past blocks, certain highlights of A Country Practice, have played
in the Christmas/New Year non-rating season. Such programming is not possible
with A Country Practice's `twin', the continuous serial, Sons and Daughters,
produced in Channel 7 studios in Sydney across the corridor from ACP.
  While the success rate in the last ten years has been striking, the soap
opera is not invariably successful. There has been a string of rating
casualties: Arcade, Punishment, Holiday Island, Taurus Rising, Waterloo
Station, Kings and Starting Out. Which means that when James Davern in 1979
put papers in his typewriter to start work on what would ultimately become
A Country Practice he had no way of knowing whether his ideas would reach
production, or whether the program would succeed in finding an audience.

<h> Another Soap </h>

Davern had had a long and varied career in television. Beginning as an engineer
with ABC radio in Melbourne in the early 1950s, he had become a pool director
in television. In that capacity he directed the pilot episode of Bellbird
in 1966. Subsequently on Bellbird, over the next seven years or so, he
was a script writer, script editor, director, producer and executive producer.
At the same time Davern wrote scripts for the Crawford police dramas and
it was on one such script that he met Lynn Bayonas, then a script editor
on Homicide. Subsequently their paths crossed again. Lynn Bayonas moved
to the ABC,and they worked together on Rush as script editor and producer.
  Davern came to Sydney as head of ABC TV Drama in 1975, and remained in
that position until he resigned in 1977. He did not immediately sever his
links with the ABC. JNP, a company he had formed, was commissioned to produce
scripts for the ABC series, Patrol Boat; Davern wrote six of its first 13
episodes and acted as script editor on the other seven. Meanwhile, Lynn
Bayonas had moved to Sydney where she worked for the ABC for three years
before going freelance as a writer. She wrote for The Box, Skyways and Holiday
Island and was `thinking of cutting my throat' after that experience when
Davern approached her with the outline of what was to become A Country
Practice.

<h> Australian pub signs </h>

<bl> By Linde McPherson </bl>

Have you ever been curious about the old beer and stout advertisements
featuring sporting heroes that recently adorned the outer walls of most
Sydney pubs? The few surviving today are quaint reminders of a lost art.

The tradition of displaying pictorial signs on the exterior of hotels has
a long history and it is to the old English pub that one looks to find direct
antecedents for our pub sign.

In 18th and 19th century, the British developed the association of sport
with alcoholic beverages. Inn keepers often organised boxing and snooker
competitions on the premises; steeplechase meetings in the fields attached
to their public houses. Archery was often practised in inn gardens.

In Sydney, Tooth and Co. adapted the British tavern pictorial signs to local
socio-economic conditions. The Tooth pub signs you see featured here reveal
an innovative and creative approach to brewery advertising of the 1930s
and represent a highly successful advertising formula which continued until
well into the 1960s.

Despite their initial similarities, Tooth pub signs developed a character
quite different to their English predecessors. This was partly due to the
fact that they served another function. That is, they advertised brands of
beer, not the existence of a specific hotel. The signs also looked different
due to the 'transfer process' technique used in their production.

This technique is similar to the manner used to apply registration labels
to car windows. The layout is first marked out in pencil on litho paper.
The design is then traced onto medium weight porous transfer paper, coated
with glue and undercoated in readiness for the design's completion in oil-based
paint.
  
Once the painting is finished it is coated lightly with a pale varnish.
When dry a second coat is applied and left tacky. The paper is then submerged
into a tray of water to loosen the glue size, lifted out, and positioned
paint surface forward onto the sheet of plate glass. A roller is then used
to remove all air bubbles and the transfer paper soaked off gently with
a sponge. The glue is washed away and excess water removed. The glass pictorial
is allowed to dry for twenty-four hours before the entire design is coated
with a heavy bodied paint to seal and protect it.

When completed the signs were distributed to hotels in the Sydney metropolitan
area as well as NSW country towns. Subjects usually related to the area.
For instance, coastal hotels featured beach scenes with lifesavers, bathers
and divers. Football pictorials showed players dressed in the local team's
colours.

Between 1930-1939, relentless pressure was directed towards the liquor industry
by the Prohibitionists. Tooth and Co. was concerned to enhance its public
image, deflate the 'wowsers' and gain publicity. Therefore, the choice of
subject matter was fundamental.

Subjects were highly idealized. The sportsmen always looked well-groomed
despite the characteristic vigour of the activity. Looking at the impeccably
turned-out footballers in the Tooth's Ale ad one is struck by the message
that football is a 'good, clean sport' which is enhanced by a beer for a
'real man', an upright citizen, neither a loafer nor a misfit.

In the 1930s women were not admitted into saloon bars: it was not considered
ladylike. The exclusion of women from hotels is reflected in the substantially
male-dominated imagery of the signs.

Women are, however, found in some of the pub signs although they are never
seen competing in any sense. They ride or sit beside their man as equals
in the cause of promoting the health-giving properties of barley and hops.
They are seen diving, swimming and riding thus giving their tacit approval to 
the product. They help to counter arguments put forward by the 'wowsers' 
relating to the harmful effects of alcohol.

With the passing of time, Tooth's pub signs became 'old fashioned' and no
longer economically viable. A more sophisticated approach to advertising
adopted by Tooths in the late 1960s meant that the pictorials became redundant.

Today, a growing interest in popular culture means that such advertising
signs now have another function and potential value as 'social documents'.
In recognition of their importance the Museum of Applied Arts and Sciences
(The Power House Museum) in Sydney obtained the entire collection of Tooth
pub signs as well as historical material relating to the company's brewing
interests.

The pub signs form an important link with social history, with advertising
techniques before the age of television and the present calculated
psychological advertising warfare. There is much to be gleaned from the
collection.

Linde McPherson has a B.A. from Sydney University majoring in the history
of art. She has researched pub signs extensively.

<h> The Art/Craft Debate Again </h>

<bl> Julie Ewington </bl>

The art-craft debate is rather like the poor relation of aesthetics: thin,
unwanted and thoroughly exhausted. In fact, everyone seems to find the whole
question a bit of an embarrassment. Craftspeople resent feeling like the
lesser cousins of artists. Artists, for their part dislike being tagged as 
culturally `superior'. Robert Rooney's evident impatience in his recent 
contribution to the debate in Craft Australia (85/3) is a case in point. It is 
evident that re-circulating the old hierarchical distinctions so familiar in the
art/craft debate won't help us out of this slough of despond.

Better ways of talking about relationships between the arts and crafts are
needed and are at hand in new perspectives brought to bear on craft practice
by several recent publications on women's traditional arts, assisted by
handy ideas borrowed from the sociology of cultural occupations. For questions
of the production of artistic, and therefore social, value merit serious
attention, no more so than when older cultural forms are being radically
re-thought through the impact of the mass media.

Gender is the most under-employed factor in the analysis of the arts and
crafts. The classic concerns of the debate have been with the nature of
craft artefacts and how they relate to the culturally privileged practices
of `Art'. Only rarely has the question been asked: `Who is making these
things?' Robin Morgan's acid one-liner has surfaced before in this journal: `What
men do is art - what women do is craft'. Like most half-truths, this crack succeeds
because of what it conceals as much as what it reveals. For Morgan neglects to 
mention that `art' and `craft' are quite distinct signifying practices in our 
culture now and have long histories of drawing on different creative traditions;
what women and men tend, as professionals, to cluster in either one or the
other; and that non-professional work in the visual arts is almost invariably
organized along gender lines that amount to social norms.

In Australia the creation of the state Crafts Council and The Crafts Council
of Australia , with all their functions including this journal, has been
the work of women. This was unique among the new arts organizations that
blossomed during the 1970s. The crafts sector is still dominated by women:
David Throsby's Australia Council report, The Artist in Australia To-day,
reveals that 61 percent of craftspeople are women, whereas in the visual
arts situation is almost the reverse, 62 percent of the artist population
surveyed is male. (The only other arts industry in which women outnumber
men is dance. See Table 3.4, Artists' Demographic Characteristics: Sex.)
So the question of gender should shed some light on the vexed art-craft
debate.

Several recent publications have been crucial to my thinking along these
lines: the second volume of All Her Labours, the Women and Labour Conference
Papers, entitled Embroidering the Framework (Hale and Iremonger, 1984, Rozsika
Parker and Griselda Pollock's Old Mistresses: Women, Art and Ideology
(Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1981) and Rozsika Parker's The Subversive Stitch:
Embroidery and the Making of the Feminine (The Women's Press, 1984).

The Australian collection, Embroidering the Framework, is as interesting
as it is diverse with articles on subjects ranging from the deliciously
seductive novels published by Mills and Boon, to the fascinating account
of why, after the Second World War, the Federal government of the day declined
to establish community and child-care*chld-care services. But one contribution
is of particular interest here: Patricia Crawford's `The Only Ornament in
a Woman: Needlework in early modern England'. This consideration of needlework
from the 16th to the 18th centuries does not attempt an assessment of the
objects themselves or the themes of the work, but offers a sociological
account of needlework as a socially sanctioned strategy for keeping women
busy. Crawford is careful to point out though, that the only women with
time on their hands (literally) were gentlewomen, and that the poorer women
were obliged to sew for their lives. The `craft' of needlework is revealed
not as one unified practice but several, pursued for different reasons and
with different results.

Apart from women condemned to what has been called `the slavery of the needle',
what did the highly-skilled creators of richly decorated household treasures
think of their labours? Patricia Crawford suggests some enjoyed it, some
accepted that it was a virtue to be kept busy, and some positively hated
the needle. Her own view is that the second response most closely represents
the contemporary social use of all this wonderful work, and it must be
recognised that Crawford is writing about one of the most glorious chapters
in the golden history of English needlework. She gives the final word to
a (male) commentator of the 1630s, John Taylor, whose view of the matter
was that the needle was entirely beneficial for all concerned:

It will increase their peace, enlarge their store,
To use their tongues less, and their Needles more.

In Crawford's account the wealth all this industry represented is barely
mentioned, nor the great status women acquired by their labours. For Crawford
needlework represented an elaborate form of servitude, but servitude
nevertheless. Her assessment that `... it gave a woman neither an economic
reward nor any kind of power' (p.12) perpetuates a denial of domestic work
in all its forms that was one part of the feminism of the 1970s.

A very different value is seen for the needle arts in the approach adopted
by Rozsika Parker and Griselda Pollock. Old Mistresses (1981) is a key text
in the reappraisal of art history's treatment of visual work by women. Its
great contribution is precisely to refuse to see women's art, crafts and
culture as evidence of unrelieved and unilateral oppression. As the authors
summed up the work:

We have tried to establish that women have always been present as artists,
but that a variety of positions have been ascribed to them at different
periods, and their ways of getting into art practice have varied and been
affected by different historical factors ... Women artists have never been
excluded from culture, but they have occupied and spoken from a different
place within it. That place can be recognised as essential to the meanings
dominant in our culture, for the insistent stereotyping of women's work
as `feminine' makes women's art a kind of opposition, a structuring category
constructed to ensure never-acknowledged masculine meanings and masculine
dominance. Such a position is for women themselves problematic and
contradictory, but also potentially radical.

Griselda Pollock, `Feminism, Femininity and the Hayward Annual Exhibition
1978'. Feminist Review, 2, 1979, (p.34).              

Thus women's traditional arts are accorded a new value by the authors. Speaking
about quilts Parker and Pollock write:

`... they are a distinctive form of art with different kinds of relations
between maker and object and between object and viewer and user which, as
William Morris foresaw, are in some ways richer than the relations of making,
using and reception customary in high art.' (p.78).

Morris was one of the first modern artists to realise the rich possibilities
of needlework and its historic importance in English culture. Rozsika Parker's
interest in it has flowered in The Subversive Stitch. It is an account of
English needlecraft  different from any other, neither endlessly descriptive,
nor dismissive, nor a `Song of the Shirt' whose only tune is complaint.

<h> The Language of Museums </h>

I hope you will forgive me if I begin with some theoretical speculation. I am doing this to make sense of what follows. The basic idea I should like to put forward is that, as humans, we create 'realities' of various kinds which enable us to think and act. We simplify existence. We construct, if you like, hypothetical models, which  become 'reality' for us. Existence itself is so diverse that there is no general agreement about what is going on, but in any particular society there are likely to be particular prevailing agreements about 'reality'. So, in a way, one can speak of the 'language' of a society and see that 'language' expressed not only in words, and visual images, but in institutions, in gestures, in clothes, in buildings, in food and in a great number of other ways, including museums, (which have been described as the cathedrals of modern society).

As  have suggested in my book, The Public Culture, in modern industrial societies one might speak of a 'public culture', of a kind that didn't exist in earlier societies. This 'public culture' purports to be 'the national life'. One might see it connected with affairs of state and ceremonies of civil religion; in the activities and values of the great bureaucracies of government, of business and of trade unions; in public propaganda (including, in capitalist societies, advertising), in what we describe as 'the news', in the entertainment, education and culture industries, in sport and tourism, in public art and architecture, in the way we spend our leisure, even in shopping. And in museums.

It is from this perspective - their place in a public culture - that we might look at museums, because museums also have, as it were, a 'language'. Museums are 'saying' something to us ('saying' some things, not 'saying' other things) and it is important to ask what is is that the museums are 'saying'.

In raising such a question I am not just talking about the intentions of the people who run museums, but about the way museums actually operate, the objective consequences of their existence, what they can actually mean to us. I will give a few examples.

The first is that of the art museum. If you ask people running an art museum what they think they are doing they are likely to give two kinds of answer. One will be connected with the storage and conservation of art objects; the other will be an educational objective. But we also know from surveys that one of the 'functions' (objective consequences) of art museums has also been to put the ordinary people in their place - to make them realise that they know nothing about art. Surveys have been done in the past which suggested that the majority of working class people who went to an art museum, could come away with a principal impression of it as a cathedral. I am not suggesting this is always or even usually the effect of art museums. One can recognise, for example, that the use of special exhibitions is one way of overcoming the awesomeness of an art museum. But often when people go to an art museum they see a whole lot of pictures put out like a child's stamp collection, with no coherent meaning - without any of the intellectual coherence, for example, that might be found in a book. And this can assist them in believing that they 'know nothing about art'.

Also worth noting is the way art museums can give an impression of 'art' that is a historical. They can sometimes lump together all kinds of products, some of which were produced by people who saw them as 'art' and others by people who didn't know the concept of  'art' in its present meaning. It has only been in modern industrial societies, with their secularism and their distinction between art and life, that the very idea of 'art' as we know it has been developed, yet one can go into, say, the first gallery of the Australian National Gallery and see lumped together in that room objects all of which are described as 'art', yet most of which, when they were first produced, were not produced as 'art' at all. An African mask, which was made for special ritual purposes, is presented as exactly the same kind of thing as a Monet water lilies study, which was produced for hanging in a museum. So another 'function' of a museum can be to project an idea of a universally acknowledged 'art' - when in fact there has been no such thing.

Another example comes from technology museums. The people who run technology museums can imagine they are giving people information about machinery, about industry, about science. But since machines do not reproduce themselves such museums must also be (whether this is intended or not) social history museums. Yet the people running them may not face up to this responsibility. Take the Science Museum in London, one of the world's greatest collections of technological devices. As soon as you walk into it you see a splendid display of steam engines arranged down the middle of the first hall that would do credit to a sculptures gallery and from this you may get the impression that somehow or other the Industrial Revolution began with steam engines - that steam engines are what most mattered about the Industrial Revolution - and as if to compound this impression, there not far away, is also the workshop of James Watt, presented as the great pioneer of the steam engine, and therefore the Industrial Revolution. There it is, the exact workshop, with five thousand pieces in it, as it was the very day Watt died. Back into your head may even come the schooldays legend of how Watt, the great genius, sat in the kitchen, watching the kettle boil and then invented the Industrial Revolution, the importance of steam engines is just one factor among many others. There is no general account of the Industrial Revolution in the Science Museum, but a particular account is inferred by the selection and arrangement of objects. Upstairs are some of the important factory machines connected with the Industrial Revolution, but even these are not given any social meaning. You learn nothing about the way in which people were already being disciplined to work in factories and in other institutions (arguably one of the important preconditions of the Industrial Revolution); nor do you learn anything about the agricultural revolution, nor about the capital accumulations from the slave trade and other profitable businesses, nor about the secularisation of society, nor about the development of banking nor about any of the other factors also seen as connected with the story of the Industrial Revolution. So if you go into the Science Museum what it is likely to 'say' to you is that technology means machines reproducing machines; one steam engine begat another steam engine, which begat another steam engine, until finally some other machine by some type of mutation begat electricity - as if the machines simply had an internal relationship with each other, reproducing each other without any human agency. This pure emphasis on technology culminates in a space museum (whether it's in Moscow or Washington) in which, with a great sense of technological triumphalism, it looks as if machines now own the universe.

A second last example: In the Scandinavian countries in particular, but also in many other places, there are great open air 'folk museums' put together at the time when the peasantry was being destroyed, taken from all kinds of regions and lumped together in typically discordant museum fashion. These are intended to recall peasant life for us, yet many ordinary middle-class persons going to them might not so much consider what peasant life was like, as look for new ideas for redecorating their own converted cottages. The open air museums of Scandinavia became, above all, the apotheosis of the wooden beam, which for several generations of Europeans has meant naturalness, sincerity and good taste.

A last example: in turning against some of the rigid discipline of the earlier museums we now have the button-pushing museum. In itself, this can seem an idea founded on very sound principles. But there is, of course, always the difficulty that in the 'fun museum', the only thing the visitor might remember is the 'fun' itself. A visit to a museum becomes an exercise in pushing buttons with the illusion, perhaps, that, somehow, by doing this, one gets the machines under control.

<h> The 'Magic' of  Museums </h>

Not only is it necessary to recognise that museums exist in particular kinds of society and that they have 'languages' which can be examined in terms of what appear to be prevailing 'realities' in these societies; we might also recognise that part of the significance of museums comes from what might be described as their 'magic'. For example, just as medieval pilgrims went to participate in the magic of holy relics in cathedrals some of the objects we see in museums are now secular relics, with an aura of scarcity, costliness and, in particular, 'authenticity'.

One of the established forms of this 'magic' comes from what Irving Goffman has described as the ceremonial agenda of obligatory rites. We tend to go to some museums partly because they are on a kind of life agenda: they are something we must go and pay our respects to: they are part of a ceremonial order that has been laid down for us. Going to museums becomes part of growing up. Again a comparison with a cathedral is relevant. Just as in the Middle Ages people might have been taken to a cathedral and shown those comic strip stories up in the windows, or in the mosaics, or in the carvings, describing important events and ideas, people can now be taken to a museum as part of the revelation of life's mysteries.

I certainly remember this from my own experience. I can remember periodic trips to museums in Sydney which acted as refresher courses in what it might mean to be human. When we went to the Art Gallery, being a human being meant partly a concern with 'the bush' and its landscapes, but more exactly, as I remember it, it was a concern for displaying reverence for nineteenth century academic art (since the Art Gallery at that stage, being a very modern gallery, was stocked with it). Above all my enormous respect for the Art Gallery came because at our house we had the four fat volumes of The Story of the British Nation, illustrated by all of the famous academy history-paintings of British history, and two of these, 'Rorke's Drift' and 'Chaucer at the Court of Edward III', were in the NSW Art Gallery. I had this feeling that there must be something important about Sydney; it had 'Rorke's Drift' and 'Chaucer at the Court of Edward III'.

We would also go to the Australian Museum. This seemed a reminder of the field of knowledge with which I was familiar at school - one studies bones and rocks and zoological classifications and so forth. There it was - knowledge, laid out for inspection in appropriate categories, like an encyclopedia (and I had as much respect for Cassell's Children's Book of Knowledge as I did for The Story of the British Nation).  What the Museum of Applied Arts and Sciences (the old one, of course) really told me was that technology had finished: the whole museum seemed so out-of-date. Technology  was something that had existed once: perhaps it reached its apex in the Strasburg Clock. However the most significant visit on our family's ceremonial agenda of obligatory rites was to the war museum (at that period housed in Sydney). When my father, who had been a digger in the Great War, would take me to the war museum, I had a real sense of meaning.

<h> Genetic engineering: the state of the art </h>

It is only 43 years since Dr Oswald Avery and his colleagues at Rockefeller
University in New York showed that DNA had some role in bacterial genetics
and heredity.

At the time it seemed a fairly unremarkable discovery, but in the intervening
years our knowledge about the pivotal role of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) in the 
development of all organisms has accelerated relent+lessly.
  To achieve the current understanding, scientists had to develop techniques
for manipulating DNA. In 1958 the first enzyme capable of the test-tube
synthesis of DNA was isolated, and in 1967 the enzyme DNA-ligase, capable
of joining two DNA chains, was discovered. These 'tools' were soon complemented
as scient+ists isolated the first of the 'restriction' enzymes that cut
the DNA chain at specific points.
  With this battery of enzymes it was only a matter of time before a bit
of cutting and stitching and tampering with the genetic code occurred and,
in 1973, Dr Herbert Boyer, Dr Stanley Cohen, and col+laborators at Stanford
University and the University of California reported that they had been
able to isolate, and artificially recombine, DNA from one strain of that
workhorse of modern molecular biology Escherichia coli and then transfer it
into another strain.
  This opened up the possibility of breach+ing the species barrier and
constructing completely new organisms that would never have existed without
the intervention of man and his test-tubes. And soon it came about, with
E. coli being the recipient of a range of plant, animal, and viral genes.
The science of genetic engineering had been born.
  Announcing the birth, the world's media trumpeted to a bewildered public
all the possibilities inherent in the miraculous new technology: super-plants,
super-cows, a cure for cancer, vast riches. Very little was left to the
imagination.
  So far the miracle hasn't eventuated. While some animal products have
entered the market-place, only one genetically engineered product with a
significant impact on human welfare has come onto the market: human insulin,
which has an unusual amino acid composition that makes it easy to produce
(see the box). Other proteins - and proteins are the major concern of genetic
engineers - have more complex structures that are not so amenable to
manipulation. 
  The molecular biology of DNA and the way the proteins it codes for are
synthesised and packaged within organisms have proved more complicated than
those early cuts and stitches in the genetic code suggested. Proteins often
need a lot of follow-up work after the DNA specifies their production. They
may need to be trimmed to the right size, or their internal structure tightened
up by the addition of, for example, a sugar molecule; in some cases they
then have to be correctly packaged and presented to the outside world.
  Scientists within CSIRO have been actively exploring the potential of
genetic engineer+ing, and some of their experiences provide insights into
the sorts of problems that have to date stymied the full development of
the new technology. The problems they have encountered emphasise the complexity
of genetic expression and reveal how a better understanding and very clever
manipula+tion of the system will be necessary if molecular biology is ever
to reach its full commercial potential in, for example, vaccine production.

<h> Developing a vaccine </h>

Many bacterial and viral pathogens have a protein that they use to attach
themselves to the cell of the organism they infect. This protein meshes
with a receptor on the host cell and, after attachment, the pathogen brings
into operation a fresh battery of proteins - enzymes - that complete the
penetration of the cell and produce the full-blown disease.
  Attachment is of fundamental import+ance to the pathogen's colonisation
of the host and continuing survival, but in the never-ending battle between
host and pathogen this is often thwarted by the activities of the host's
immune system.
  Circulating white blood cells focus on molecules on the surface of the
pathogen, including the attachment protein (im+munologists call these molecules
antigens), and this leads to the host synthesising a matching protein (or
antibody) that, just like the receptor on a vulnerable cell, binds to the
invading protein, effectively immobilising the pathogen. Soon after, the
invader is devoured by the scavenging cells that form another part of the
immune system's armoury.
  Vaccination is a way of accelerating the host-pathogen interplay. Killed or
attenuated pathogens, incapable of causing a full-blown infection, are introduced 
into the potential host. The host's immune system responds as if it has been 
assaulted by the fully infectious pathogen and pro+duces antibodies, which 
continue circulat+ing in the body, protecting the host from any fresh challenge by 
the pathogen.
  The production of vaccines is a sophisti+cated process with high standards
that need to be maintained: major public health problems have arisen when
people were dosed with `killed' pathogens that still retained their
pathogenicity. In addition, the process is often difficult and/or expen+sive.
For example, production of the influenza vaccine involves growing the virus
in fertilised hen's eggs. Many of these problems could quickly be overcome
if the pathogen DNA (or the related ribonucleicacid, RNA) coding for the attachment
protein, or other relevant antigens, could be isolated and then synthesised
in a friendly bacterium.
  A new generation of vaccines is being developed for a wide range of human
and animal diseases, and one that has reached a fairly advanced stage of
development is for footrot - a crippling, debilitating disease of sheep
caused by the bacterium bacteroides nodosus. A conventional vac+cine against 
footrot is available, but its production and quality are beset by the sorts of 
problems mentioned above, and its high cost - about 80 cents a dose, with two 
doses being necessary - deters graziers from using it.

<h> Fighting footrot </h>

Dr David Stewart of the CSIRO Division of Animal Health, Dr John Mattick,
Dr Brian Dalrymple, and Ms Margaret Bills, of the CSIRO Division of Molecular
Biology, and Dr Tom Elleman, Dr Neil McKern, and Mr Peter Hoyne, of the
CSIRO Division of Protein Chemistry, along with Ms Beau Anderson and Professor
John Egerton, of the Faculty of Veterinary Science at the University of
Sydney, have made consider+able progress in developing a new footrot vaccine
through the use of recombinant-DNA technology.
  Dr Stewart and his colleagues at the Division of Animal Health showed
that the important footrot protein occurs in the fine hair-like filaments
covering the surface of the B. nodosus cell. Although the exact function
of these `hairs', termed fimbriae, in the footrot organism is uncertain,
it seems likely that they are involved in attachment to, or colonisation
of, the tissues of the hoof by the bacterium. Once attached, the invader
then produces an array of enzymes that break down the protein in hoof tissues
and produce the footrot syndrome.
  The fimbrial proteins are built up from protein sub-units, and their
production through genetic engineering could simplify vaccine production.
The first step in the construction of such a vaccine is the isolation of
the genes responsible for the fimbrial protein and its assembly.
  The scientists achieved this by breaking up the B. nodosus DNA with a
restriction enzyme and then placing individual frag+ments into a plasmid
- a short piece of bacterial DNA - that also contained a gene coding for
antibiotic resistance. After these `recombinant' DNA molecules were transferred
into E. coli, they cultured the bacteria on a medium amended with antibiotic.
  A combination of genetic tricks enabled the scientists to determine which
bacterial colonies (or clones) contained the B. nodosus DNA; and to find
out which ones contained the fimbrial sub-unit gene, the team challenged
the bacteria with antibodies against the fimbrial protein. Out of the two
thousand clones prepared, eight were found to be producing the sub-unit.
  But it's not so simple as that: while these genetically engineered E.
coli could be induced to produce copious quantities of the fimbrial protein
sub-unit, no mature fimbriae were formed. A closer look at individual bacteria
revealed why: the sub-unit protein was embedded in the cell membrane and
had gone no further. The group then tried the same trick with a strain
of E. coli that possesses fimbriae but, again, mature fimbriae refused to
form.
  From other studies on the fimbriated E. coli, the Australian group knew
that a cluster of five or six genes is involved in the construction of
fimbriae. One codes for the fimbrial sub-unit, another for a larger protein
that anchors the fimbriae to the cell wall, and the remainder are apparently
involved in the assembly of the mature fimbriae.
  A similar assembly system probably operates in B. nodosus; presumably
the other genes involved were not transferred to E. coli along with the
sub-unit protein gene and this may explain their failure to produce typical
fimbriae. However, attempts to transfer a larger party of the B. nodosus
genome, or to use E. coli's fimbrial assembly genes, have thus far provided
no solution.
  Evidently there is a basic incompatibility between the fimbrial systems
of these two bacteria. However, when Dr McKern sequenced the B. nodosus
protein sub-unit it became clear that this had a great many similarities
with those occurring in the fimbriae of Neisseria gonorrhoeae (one of the
venereal disease organisms), Moraxella bovis (the cause of pink eye in
cattle), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (a common sap+rophyte.)
  P. aeruginosa, in particular, is easy to grow and its genetics are well
understood. More importantly its fimbrial assembly machinery is compatible
with that of B. nodosus because, when the scientists trans+ferred the footrot
bacterium's protein sub-unit genes into it, the new host produced bulk
quantities of intact mature B. nodosus fimbriae. A patent application has
been lodged for this process and preliminary tests on the fimbriae suggest
that they are at least as good as the conventionally produced vaccine. And,
because P. aeruginosa is easier to grow than the footrot bacterium, the
protein yield is much higher, suggesting that production may be much simpler.
  At present the footrot vaccine is being put through further trials involving
the various CSIRO Divisions and the University of Sydney, and an agreement
between CSIRO and two animal health companies for its commercial production
is being negotiated. There are still some technical problems to be overcome
- one, a rather common complaint in genetic engineering, is that the
recombinant bacteria tend to be unstable in culture - but if all goes well
Australian graziers should be able to make use of one of the first genetically
engineered vaccines in the near future.

<h> Engineering plants and animals </h>

Bacteria have made such an enormous contribution to the science of molecular
biology because of their simplicity. As members of the group of organisms
known as prokaryotes, they lack a membrane-bound nucleus where the DNA is
found. The great bulk of the bacterial DNA occurs in a single long chromosome
floating around the cell's interior; as such, it is easily accessible compared
with the DNA found in the eukaryotic organisms - plants and animals - that
have a nucleus.
  The eukaryotic cells of plants and animals contain much more DNA, packaged
away in the nucleus. Any introduced foreign DNA has to traverse the cell
membrane (and with plants a substantial cellulose cell wall before the
membrane) and then the nuclear membrane, before it can possibly be integrated
into the host genome. Such a tortuous path presents problems to biologists
attempting to manipulate the genetics of plants and animals.
  Large numbers of bacteria can easily be grown from a single cell using
only rela+tively simple media containing carbon and nitrogen sources, some
minerals, and possi+bly some growth factors such as the B-group vitamins;
but plant and animal cells are much more demanding and this creates further
complications.
  Individual eukaryotic cells are difficult to manipulate and they demand
extra growth factors, such as those found in blood serum or an array of
hormones, if they are ever to grow in culture. Even then they are still very
refractory.
  For example, members of the cereal family - including the rice, maize,
and wheat that provide the bulk of the world's calories - refuse to form
complete plantlets, capable of growing on in the wider world after removal
from their test-tube residence.

<h> Living in the Pilbara </h>

<h> When the earth moves, so does the population </h>

<bl> By Phil Jarratt </bl>

  WHEN my father left the Pil+bara for the last time, 45 years ago, he wasn't
leaving much behind. Just a long, long jetty, which was the pride of his
town, a failed butcher shop, a few good friends and three streets of slap-up
huts which had been knocked down by a blow and slapped up again, all in the
space of a decade and a half.
  When Hitler marched on Poland, my dad and his mates marched - well, drove
- on Perth, covering the 1200 corrugated dirt kilometres in just 26 hours
in my father's '34 Chevy. They had the world in front of them and the
rock-hard, heartbreak dust of the Pil+bara behind them, and in those days
there was a reason to be cheerful at every milepost south.
  In the early part of this century the north-west of our country was as
inhospitable as it was in 1688 when William Dampier had noted sourly on
disembarkation at Shark Bay:
  "The land is of a dry sandy soil, destitute of water, except you make
Wells ... the Inhabitants of this Country are the Miserablest People in
the world."
  It was a place where men came to make fortunes and then got the hell out.
It was not a place that inspired new beginnings and yet many of those lured
by its mineral potential stayed on - more often out of financial necessity
than desire. My grandfather, Walter Oswald Jarratt, was one who stayed.
Lured from the Victorian farm+lands by the prospect of riches, he worked
in the huge Whim Creek cop+per mine at the turn of the century and stayed
on to watch it become the biggest and most profitable in the Southern
Hemisphere. 
  When its German owners were in+terned during World War I, however, the
mine fell on hard times and my grandfather was retrenched. In 1916, the
year my father was born, Walter Oswald was hustling a buck the best way
he could, odd-jobbing around the big stations of the North West, hunting
camels and sinking fence posts. But the work became scarce in the 1920s
and, with a wife and four children to support, my grand+father drifted south
in search of new opportunities.
  In 1925, he heard about the exciting developments at the town of Onslow
at the mouth of the Ashburton River. A major jetty was under construction
at nearby Beadon Point and the entire town of some 150 residents was to
be relocated. There were construction jobs aplenty, so Walter Oswald loaded
his family and all his worldly goods into the back of his Willys Overland,
threw a tarp over the perishables and hit the dusty track.
  The new town of Onslow was noth+ing more than a half-finished hotel and
some hastily-built shacks dotted along the beachfront between the jetty and
the creek, but he was able to rent two rooms from the mailman and the family
established itself amidst the sand and the sawdust. By the time the
construction work was finished the Jarratts had come to re+gard Onslow as
home. Searching for a permanent niche, Walter Oswald returned to his original
trade and opened a butcher shop. He supplied meat to the townsfolk and visiting
pearlers, whose luggers made use of the new jetty at the southernmost point
of their sweeps out of Broome.
  When Walter Oswald died unexpec+tedly in 1931, my father left school and
donned the apron. His three sis+ters took turns behind the counter and their
mother, Jesse, smartly ac+quainted herself with the noble art of bookkeeping.
But my father was not cut out for cutting up carcasses. At night in his
bachelor pad near the Beadon Hotel he studied the radio operators' manual
and dreamed of a life at sea in the radio room of a grand ship, far away
from the choking dust of the Pilbara and the depressing salt+pans of the
Ashburton.
  Among my earliest memories are faded photographs of a great twisting jetty
- the pride of Onslow - and the homely old Beadon Hotel with its vast
verandahs, the luggers in port and the fine-chiselled features of the Malays
and Japanese who manned the pearl-diving bells. Accompanying these photos
was a wealth of bedtime stories about the characters of the old North West
and the harsh, honest lives they endured.
  The Pilbara seemed to me then such a romantic last frontier, full of the
sights and sensations a city boy could never know. By the time I left school,
the Pilbara had come to mean something quite different. It was the heart
of the fabulous mining boom, wherein raced the pulse of the State of Excitement
in those heady days of the late 1960s. It was big red moun+tains of iron
ore, the deafening roar of heavy machinery and a place where towns sprang
up out of the desert almost overnight. It was, we were told, Australia's
future, but it was Newman and Tom Price, not Cossack or Roe+bourne, and
my father was the only person who ever spoke of Onslow.

<h> ENTER AN ARMY OF MEN AND MACHINES </h>

  Seen from the air, the new towns of the Pilbara look like the cross+hatching
on an artist's unfinished landscape. They are orderly, like tiny pieces
of Canberra hurled across the map. They are green on a canvas of brown,
the result of years of hard work with the watering can.
  On closer inspection the towns are uniformly neat (`Tom Price is a tidy
town' proclaims the sign) and seemingly soulless. Shopping centres point
inwards, as though ashamed of their enterprise, and pubs are brick cells
attached to drive-in bottle shops. The rows of houses remind me, as do those
of the Woden and Belconnen valleys and the new suburbs of Dar+win, of nothing 
so much as the facades of sweet-smelling suburbia knocked up on Hollywood
back-lots for the filming of situation comedies - so normal they become
surreal. It is as if the building code was devised by an automaton.
  In stark contrast to the orderly streets is the backdrop of spinifex and
wild mountain ranges. From the Tropic of Capricorn north to the edge of
the Great Sandy Desert, there is not a Pilbara township out of sight of
the great prehistoric escarpments of the Hamersley and Chichester Ranges.
Over 2000 million years old, these mountains are scarred with fault lines
and lava flows, and give way to deep and terrifying gorges. It is dramatic
country in every way, but no less dra+matic has been its development over
the past two decades.
  The mineral wealth of the Pilbara has been known and exploited for almost
a century, but the booms in gold, copper, manganese, tin, lead and silver
have come and gone, leaving ghost towns and shattered dreams in their wake.
Since 1960, however, when the then Prime Minister Sir Robert Menzies repealed
the embargo on the export of iron ore, that metal has ruled the region.
Getting it out of the ground and onto huge ships has become the lifeblood of
the Pilbara's growing population. 
  At the 1961 census there were 4000 residents in the four shires of the
Pilbara; by 1981 the population was almost 50,000, and one company alone
- the giant Hamersley Iron - had invested more than $1.2 billion in plants,
ports, railways and company town dormitories for the workforce. Its mining
operation had become so immense that each day nine, mile-long ore trains
hauled more than 150,000 tonnes of iron ore from the mines at Tom Price
and Paraburdoo to the port of Dampier, where a daily ore carrier was completely
loaded and sent on its way to Japan.
  The mind-boggling enormity of Hamersley Iron's development is dwarfed,
however, by the broader consideration of what remains un+touched: some
200 billion tonnes of high-grade (68 per cent or better) iron ore, by one
prospector's estimation.
  "A hell of a bloody lot!" according to Lang Hancock, the rogue bull of
the Pilbara. Since his discovery of the Tom Price deposits in 1952, Hancock
has fuelled his vision of the Pilbara becoming the `Ruhr of South-East Asia'
with the $30,000 a day he re+ceives in prospector's royalties from Hamersley
Iron.
  Hancock, now 76 and without a pilot's license since a heart bypass operation,
claims to have found the ore deposits as he flew through a gorge to avoid
low cloud on a trip to Perth. He later returned to the spot in a jeep and
staked a claim. But he did not go public with his high-grade find until
the iron embargo was lifted. He then set about finding a backer who could
finance such a giant under+taking. In 1962, Hamersley Iron was born out
of an alliance between the British-based Conzinc Riotinto and the American
Kaiser Steel.
  Two years later the company signed contracts with seven major Japanese
steel mills and, in 1966, operations began at Tom Price. Into the heat and
dust of the Pilbara came an army of men and machines.

<h> DESERT SUBURBIA </h>

  In Paraburdoo on a Sunday night, the hotel (another brick cell) closes
at 7 o'clock, but visitors are welcome at the Demons Australian Rules Foot+ball
Club, a shed on the edge of town past the drive-in movies.
  Like all male-dominated mining towns, Paraburdoo is mad about sport and,
like all sports-loving miners, the men of Paraburdoo have power+ful thirsts.
Thus in the Demons on a Sunday night, after a big weekend of footie, golf,
archery and tennis, it is perhaps understandable if the last-drinks bell
is roundly ignored and the members and guests continue to slake their thirsts
with Emu Bitter. A dozen or so of the town's 344 single men, cleanshaven
but tough in sing+lets and shorts, remain in the bar. The conversation is
about the need to get involved in as many diversions as possible and the
need to get out of town - to Perth or to Asia - as often as possible.
  "I save up and go to Thailand," says a miner named Andy. "Not just for
the women either. I go rafting up near Chiang Mai. That's about as far away
from mining as you can get."
  But even in the very middle of a company town a man can lose him+self
in leisure.  For this reason Parabur+doo, with fewer than 2500 residents,
boasts 29 sporting clubs - includ+ing tae kwon do, pistols, darts, dog
breeding, speedway and the Hash House Harriers - and 13 service clubs, including
an amateur repertory company.
  The town's facilities, built by Ham+ersley Iron little more than a decade
ago, are superb, although some, such as the 18-hole golf course, have to
be viewed within the context of the generally brutish environment.
  "Iron ore fairways and sand greens," said club champion Bob Pepper,
deli+cately chipping onto the oiled green, where the ball came to an abrupt
halt.  "We tee off on rubber pads and gener+ally don't have any problems
on the fairway, unless you hit a chunk of ore and ricochet into the scrub.
It's these sand greens that are a bastard to play. We mix oil into the sand
to make it stick together, but you really can't putt on it. We've got an
Astroturf green on order and I can't wait until we've got 18 of them."
  Pepper, a 10-handicapper who drives truckloads of ore from the open face
to the crusher for seven hours each evening, plays nine holes every morn+ing
and 18 on Sunday afternoons. He loves his golf, even on a track of iron.
  "It's the only thing that keeps me sane," he said with a grin.
  The mine, tucked behind the hills just a few kilometres out of town, directly
employs more than two-thirds of the population. The rest of the workforce
looks after the needs of the miners. In other words, despite a process which
is quaintly called 'normalisation', if you haven't sold your soul to Hamersley
Iron you don't belong in Paraburdoo.

<h> Our wealth is our people </h>

<bl> By Phil Noyce </bl>

"OUR wealth is our people", proclaimed the tourist poster from Cyprus. "Imagine
selling Australia with a line like that", I mused. My cynicism took a more
positive turn with the thought, "what a lucky country to be able to talk
about its people as a unified group." And as for the notion of people being
the source of wealth, it seemed quaint and folksy - good for tourist images
of a poor peasant economy, clever propaganda for a country invaded by a
foreign power - all up, quite inapplicable to a country like Australia.
  Comparisons with Australia did however, begin to provoke some important
questions, such as: who are our people? With migration upon migration, can
we ever become a unified group - Australians? Then there's the wealth side
of the equation: our wealth is our natural resources. Our people are our
consumers. Agriculture and mining have kept us living in the manner we've
become accustomed to. They've provided us with all that goes with being
a developed country - high levels of expenditure on education, health and
welfare, public transport, social security and so on. Food in our bellies,
money in our pockets and a roof over our heads are things we have taken
for granted.
  1986 has seen that comfortable view take quite a jolt, with the plummeting
of the Australian dollar on the world stage. Suddenly, it seems, we're out
in the cold; our friends have found others to play with and nobody seems
to want what we've got like they used to. It's time to do some very serious
stocktaking. What are our assets? How have we got into this mess? What's
happening to us and what can we do about it?
  The history of Australia's sources of wealth seems to go something like
this:
1. We have ridden on the sheep's back. We have relied on minerals and natural
resources for our source of wealth. We do rely on non-human resources.
2. Because we had the money, we've been able to prop up manufacturing industry
via tariffs and other forms of protection whenever it couldn't stand on its
own two feet.
3. Services such as education, health and welfare consume huge amounts of
the wealth generated from elsewhere. Our people are anything but the source
of our wealth.
  While that may be an over+simplification of our past, it's a recipe for
disaster if applied to our future. To underscore my case, let me add a fourth
point to this primary/secondary/tertiary sector analysis: `established'
Australians - those from between two and eight generations of occupancy
of this country - have been subsidised to date by schemes that no longer
produce wealth in an internationally competitive way. That is, economic
strategies that worked for us forty and more years ago have produced a new
Australia, with new problems, new resources, new possibilities but are
nonetheless redundant, wornout strategies now.
  For example, immigration, largely from Southern Europe, provided the
immediate workforce for post-war industrial expansion. Migrants came,
fundamentally, for better life oppor+tunities for their children. With minor
concessions to the influence on cuisine, fashion, design, film and the arts,
the chief economic contributions to Australia that have been accorded
recognition by Anglo-Australia are muscle power and menial work. Now that
the need for this type of work is drying up (and their children growing
or grown up) we're faced with new challenges
  Riding on the sheep's back, living off mineral wealth and leaving the
dirty work to others has developed some rather insular, non-productive and
ingrained habits in the most urbanised country in the world. Australia's
mainstream cultural institutions - the ABC, the VFL, the universities and
school systems, to mention a few - reflect prevailing attitudes in Anglocentric
Australia that barely recognise the multi+cultural reality of this country.
We're now faced with critical choices between continuing along the old "she'll
be right" path or beginning to have a long and careful look at just who
Australians really are, if we're to make the best of what we've got.

<h> Education in an Industrial economy </h>

As Industrial tecnology operates on a hierarchy of management/design/assembly-line 
for production of goods, there has to be a system of sorting out who does what. 
Given the choice, most of us would prefer to be the supervising engineer rather 
than the labourer, the chief executive rather than the stenographer, the farmer 
rather than the farm-hand.
  For its part, the education system has helped Australia's industrial cogs
run smoothly by providing both training in the professions and trades and the
selection mechanisms to help sort out who does what. But getting the right
balance between the twin, often conflicting functions of selection and skilling
is fundamentally an economic, not an educational question. Or, to put it
another way, the social and economic requirements for selection are imposed
on education, which takes its task as that of minimising the anti-educational
imp+act created by the need to sort, stream and classify students for the
world outside. Education, after all, is about extending, developing, empowering
individuals and inducting them into the culture.
  Whereas credentialling plays a vital role in deciding and legitimising
who gets to do what in the world of work, education is also meant to provide
the chance for a better life for individuals and to contribute to the national
bank of skills, understanding and knowledge. Proponents of strengthening
this latter function of schooling have largely been regarded as on the `soft'
side of the education debate, the former being regarded as the economic
imperative. Education has a number of instruments to assist in the labour
sorting process, including the following:
System structures, which confine particular cohorts of students by the way
the institutions are set up - technical schools, girls schools, private
schools, public schools, TAFE Colleges, the universities and so on.
Credentialling structures, which define the currency ratings by which a
qualification can be valued and compared with other qualifications.
Institutional practices, which refine selection between individuals at the
classroom level, using methods such as streaming, ranking and grading.

<h> Enter the Information Revolution </h>

  If robots start replacing assembly-line workers, computers do all the
routine calculations and word processors replace typewriters, we find ourselves
either with a lot less jobs or a lot of different ones in need of creation.
Given that, our only chance to remain internationally compet+itive and with
full employment is to look to the creation of new jobs. What might they
look like, what skills will they require, are the central questions.
  Whereas industrial technology required the strict and narrow separation of
job functions, of clear divisions of labour, information technology requires
a convergence of abilities, a fusion of skills and a broader understanding
of the purpose of the task.
  It is the advent of information technology into industry, farms, schools,
home and office that has upset the balance not only in education but in
all of our institutions. If there's no great call for bank-tellers who are
a whizz at add-ups, what does that mean for maths at school? What does it
mean for bank-tellers? If I'm working on a machine that performs functions
spanning seven industrial areas, what does that mean about my union coverage?
  Take for example, the way I'm writing this article: a few years ago, it
would be written out longhand, edited, re-written, given to a typist, marked
up and sent out for typesetting, brought back for proof+reading, corrected,
given to a designer and then to a compositor for page makeup. What I'll
do when I finish typing now on a personal computer is have a look at it
on the screen, make some editorial, typographical and layout decisions and
click the printout button.
  Between the current revolution in desktop publishing and everything in
printing since the invention of the linotype machine, clearly then, a lot
is happening. For example, WYSIWYG -"What You See Is What You Get", is
a name given to computer programs that show you on the screen what your
page will look like when it's printed. It means that the author is in control
of the product. It means that the divisions of labour created by the technology
of the Industrial Age - writer, typist, sub+editor, typesetter, proofreader,
designer, compositor, printer - can now be merged (once again) into the
labour of one person.
  At its most profound, the advent of information technology heralds and
enables a return to Renaissance values and the indivisibility of thought,
creativity, action and work. At its most sinister, (and I would argue,
economically foolish) it could simply be used to wipe out jobs.
  In short, information technology has dramatic implications for work
manage+ment, for the structure of the union movement, for the role of education
and the content of schooling - everything.
  The critical thing to understand about the Information Revolution is the
concept and practice of technological convergence: the combining of computers,
telecommun+ications and information systems to form new tools. To use them
well (both in application and in the development of new tools), we need
to have general and broad, rather than particular and specialised skills.

<h> An international comparison - the Japanese ascendancy </h>

  The Japanese are in a position of technological and economic ascendancy
precisely because they understand this idea of technological convergence best
and build their work organisation, union movement, education system and
so on around it. People are described as `underskilled', never `unskilled'
and it's everybody's responsibility to raise the general skill and competency
level.
  This leads to what seem to Australian eyes as novel approaches to work
management and practice. For example, the use of `quality circles' (discussion
sessions that include all staff, from apprentices to management),
industry-based, rather than craft-based union organisation and their traditions
of company loyalty are only three of a whole complex of factors that make
the Japanese particularly adept in exploiting the emerging cross-disciplinary
technol+ogies, such as `mechatronics': the fusion of mechanics, electronics
and robotics, or `optoelectronics': the fusion of optics and electronics.
These industries are now providing a wide range of employment in areas such
as manufacturing, information processing and alternative energy development.
  The fact that they have a monocultural society with values that, to a
multi+culturalist, would only be described as racist, is a cultural reality
which has been put to great economic advantage via their work organisation.
When Mr Nakasone makes public statements to the effect that the Japanese
are more knowledgeable and perhaps more intelligent than Americans because
the US has allowed blacks, Puerto Ricans and Mexicans to settle in America,
he is apparently echoing widely held sentiments in Japan. Whether his
explanations are correct or appropriate is not important for the point I
want to make, which is this: a clear sense of cultural identity is the
foundation of a nation's activity and productivity, and in that respect,
we have much to learn from others.

<h> What does all this mean for Australia? </h>

  What does all this mean for Australia, a polyglot, multi-lingual nation
without a clear sense of its own traditions and a brief history of being
wealthy because we were naturally well-endowed. Clearly, it cannot mean
that we try to mimic the practices of cultures totally different from our
own. Equally clearly, we do need to understand better what makes economic+ally
successful countries tick, (partic+ularly where we import holus-bolus the
technologies they produce, if only to use them effectively and with
understanding). Most important of all, we need to reassess what our people
assets are and how we might best develop and exploit those riches -
international ties with the non-English speaking world, the language assets
of over a hundred ethnic minorities, the cultural links of almost one-third
of the population of this country who come from non-English speaking
backgrounds, the potential for tourism created by the devaluation of the
dollar, to mention a few peculiarly Australian assets, each with massive
potentialities for use in conjunction with existing information technologies.
We do, in short, have much more to sell the world than Hoges and Fosters.

<h> Folk flower tonics </h>

<bl> by Roy Victor Love, Kuraby, Qld. </bl>

Last issue we looked at how the tonics worked, converting flowers into tonics,
making personal mixtures and included instructions and guidelines for making
up and dispensing the folk flower tonics.

<h> Folk Flower Tonics </h>

<misc> BANKSIA, Banksia integrifolia (boiling method) </misc>
The lemon coloured cylindrical shaped flowers of this native occur all year
round, but more often during autumn or late winter. The seeds are shed soon
after maturity, unlike other banksias which retain their seed until the
death of the plant. The Banksia remedy is for a feeling of insecurity or
fear of the future, also a slightly wrong approach to life.

<misc> BLUE BILLY GOAT WEED, Ageratum houstenianum (sun method) </misc>
The prolific blue pom-pom flower is attractive to some people and not to
others. This plant grows wild in many gardens as a weed. It has been effective
in cases of loneliness, isolation and introversion. Key words - `lost and
lonely'.

<misc> BLUE PIMPERNEL, Anagallis arvensis (caerulea) (sun method) </misc>
This plant is poisonous and looks like chick weed. It has a pretty little blue
flower and grows in the cooler mountain regions. Only the flower is used,
which is not poisonous and is attached to the plant with a very fine stem.
For purity of thought and wisdom; when we know we should rise above `angry
feelings' even though there may be justification for

<misc> BLACK-EYED SUSAN, Thunbergia alata (sun method) </misc>
A dainty flower with yellow petals and a `black eye' in the centre, it secretes
a sweet sap which attracts ants. This creeper has also been called `Bright
Eyes'. This tonic has been helpful in treating a despondency due to lack
of direction in life. For the person who lacks perception and cannot see
the real functioning of things - he or she cannot see the wood for the trees.
`Bright Eyes' is for insight.

<misc> BROWN KNAPWEED, Centaurea jacea (sun method) </misc>
A pink-mauve flower atop a long stem. The leaves are long and narrow. We
found this plant growing wild in black soil but it is not a native of
Australia. For a complete lack of confidence, for people who are too influenced
in times of trouble by other people's criticism of their actions, both past
and present. This remedy helps a person to again take charge of their life
and decisions.

<misc> CREEPING LANTANA, Lantana motevidensis (sun method) </misc>
This creeper has a purple flower, similar to that of the lantana*lantan bush. It
grows over fences, ground or shrubs, and is frequently used in gardens and
landscaping. This tonic is for thoughts that trouble and preoccupy you before
or after friction or conflict with someone, irrespective of who is in
the right. It is also for hate and allied thoughts - it promotes love.

<misc> CREPE MYRTLE, Lagerstroemia indica (boiling method) </misc>
This shrub bears profuse soft, crinkly flowers which weigh the limbs down.
The variety we potentised is of a soft pink colour. This remedy is for
disillusionment or disappointment, if one expects people to feel the same
about certain subjects or aspects as oneself. This will help to bring about
tolerence*tolerance of other people's attitudes and priorities.

<misc> DAY LILY, Hemerocallis lilioasphodelus (sun method) </misc>
The variety potentised has individual flowers on strong stems above tall,
grassy foliage. When faced with seemingly insurmountable problems or emotional
worries, this remedy will allow you to take one day at a time, to break down the 
large problem into smaller manageable ones.

<misc> GOLDEN WREATH WATTLE, Acacia saligna (sun method) </misc>
This native has pom-pom flowers and long narrow leaves. The Golden Wreath
Wattle blooms in August or September. This is for people who are worn-out
or weak during spring and early summer.

<misc> IVORY CURL FLOWER, Buckinghamia celsissima (sun method) </misc>
Bushy evergreen native shrub with masses of sweet-smelling cream flowers
in summer. This remedy is for the elusive fear that one cannot fight because
its source cannot be pinpointed. It can be for a spiritual fear of something
trying to tear one down; or for the nameless terrors than can come upon
an individual for no particular reason.

<misc> MOONLIGHT CACTUS, Hylocereus undatus (sun method) </misc>
`The Ray of Light' is a big beautiful cactus which blooms at night in late
summer. This remedy is for the person who is searching for light in the
darkness, and will help them to see which way to go, and to reason out their
problems.

<misc> MORTON BAY CYPRESS/BRIBIE PINE, Callitris columellaris (boiling method) </misc>
This large tree is a native of the Morton Bay area and is laden with pollen
when flowering. It is a soothing remedy for helping to calm a restless, uneasy
feeling, and has been used for emergencies and in panic situations.

<misc> MOSCHOSMA, Iboza riparia (sun method) </misc>
A deciduous shrub with soft, grey green foliage, bearing small feathery
flowers in autumn or winter. When crushed the leaves have a strong smell.
For tiredness through being drained by people who need love and understanding.
This remedy is invaluable for those people working with patients, eg. social
workers, practitioners, healers, who give a lot of themselves, and can
therefore become very depleted.

<misc> NASTURTIUM, Tropaeolum majus (sun method) </misc>
This ground cover plant is commonly found in gardens and has rounded leaves and red 
or yellow flowers. This is a soothing remedy for tired people who seem to
have small reserves of energy which are often and easily depleted.

<misc> PINK PERIWINKLE, Catharanthus roseus </misc>
This appears similar to the pie-eyed periwinkle, but the leaves are bright
pink. This is for people who need love, attention or pampering. They feel
they have missed out on their share of recognition for their efforts. They
feel they deserve more attention. In children this may appear as aggression.

<misc> PINK SHAMROCK, Oxalis latifolia (sun method) </misc>
A small plant, this garden weed is very prolific under shady trees. It has
a tri-lobed leaf like clover, but much bigger, on a straight stalk of up
to 10 to 20 cm. The flower is mauve-pink. It is for acceptance of, or
adjustment to, change.

<misc> PIE-EYED PERIWINKLE, Catharanthus roseus (sun method) </misc>
This flower has five plain white petals on a plant which grows to 60 cm high.
The centre of the flower is pink, thus `pie-eyed'. A remedy for the suppressed
spirit which is trying to give expression but cannot because it feels trapped
in a situation. This feeling can lead to depression and hopelessness because
creative ability is supressed*suppressed.

<misc> PRIMULA, Primula obconica (sun method) </misc>
A garden plant with small pink and mauve flowers. This remedy has been helpful
for shock eg. accidents, bad news.

<misc> PURPLE GINGER, Dichorisandra thyrsiflora (sun method) </misc>
This garden plant has long leaves and beautiful purple flowers growing in
clusters on an upright stem. This tonic helps those who have been through
a difficult time gather their thoughts and compose themselves. It eases
the accompanying mental exhaustion, and may be needed after another remedy
or series of remedies has helped the patient.

<misc> QUEEN OF THE NIGHT CACTUS, Epiphyllum sp. (sun method) </misc>
This beatiful bloom looks almost the same as Moonlight Cactus. For the person
who has made progress but is in danger of slipping back, and who needs
strengthening to move on. They may have overcome an illness or crisis, but
their health is still hanging on a fine thread.

<misc> SENSITIVE BUSH, Mimosa pudica </misc>
A ground creeper with small leaflets which close when disturbed. It has
small, fluffy, pale pink flowers. The nature of this plant seems to point
to the type of person who closes off to the outside world; loneliness, and
to some extent shyness.

<misc> SMART WEED (PERSICARIA), Polygonum Lathifolium (sun method) </misc>
When I applied to have this flower and plant identified, Smart Weed was
the name that the government botanist gave to it. However, I have since seen
a colour sketch of it in a book, labelled Persicaria. This remedy helps
to strengthen the mind for good during times of mental conflict. It erases
the impulse to do the wrong thing under stress conditions, or indeed at any
time. It can help people who, through an impulse that is not their real
self, have difficulty in giving up food, alcohol, drug or smoking addictions.
Their real self wants to give it up but the impulsive self wants the addiction.
In some rare cases a patient will become slightly worse at first when taking
Persicaria, but if they are patient and keep trying they will win the battle.

<misc> SILKY OAK, Grevillea robusta (sun method) </misc>
A big tree with sticky sweet flowers. This remedy is for nostalgia and for people
who have an emptiness in life due to change or loss of someone or something
- a bereavement. The positive side is making home in the present with a
full heart.

<misc> TRIGGER PLANT, Stylidium graminifolum (sun method) </misc>
This plant has dainty pink flowers growing on a long stem. A remedy for
temporary frustration because present circumstances prevent the realisation
of dreams and ambitions.

<misc> TANSY, Tanacetum vulgare (sun method) </misc>
A herb with small yellow button-like flowers, found in many gardens. This
is for the very deep depression and despair that one sinks into when feeling
cut off from all that one has previously held dear. Doubt of one's faith,
chosen path in life, or partner, when previously one had been so sure of
following the right way. Very deep despair and doubt.

<misc> VETCH, Vicia sativa guarangustifolia (sun method) </misc>
A legume which grows wild in the spring. It grows about 30 cm high and has
small pods which are quite edible but too small to be of value for food.
This remedy has a soothing effect on a troubled person who does not know
what job to do first. If they start one job they feel guilty that they should
be doing something else. The vetch remedy will make them happy doing one
thing at a time and be more efficient.

<misc> WHITE GINGER, Hedychium coronarium </misc>
This grows to approx 2 m high with large, firm, white, very fragrant flowers.
This remedy is for the person who is attempting to live a more spiritually
oriented or an improved lifestyle where more help can be given to their
fellow man. Modern living demands can lock this person's thinking too much
into the physical day-to-day life.

<misc> WHITE PERIWINKLE, Catharanthus roseus c. v. albus (sun method) </misc>
This flower is similar to the pie-eyed vinca, but has no pink eye. It is
sometimes called Madagascar Perrywinkle. Vinca is a common garden plant
which comes in many colours. This remedy is soothing and orientating to
a troubled, depressed or scattered spirit.

<misc> WILD CARROT, Daucus carota (sun method) </misc>
A cluster of white flowers with a small black central spot. This remedy
is for the person who suffers from feelings of being a black sheep, and the
odd one out in their present company.

<h> As We Turned the Soil </h>

<bl> by Patricia Fisher, Cowra, NSW. </bl>

  We discovered Grass Roots by accident ten years ago. Thank you for changing
the direction of our life. Looking back though I realise how innocent we
must have seemed to all those well-meaning people who warned us against
going to the country. I was city born and bred and knew nothing of the
hardships of country life. We were young yes, but with three tiny sons to
feed my husband wasn't about to throw a good job in the air and try to eke
out a living in the depths of the bush somewhere, however much we longed
to. Our babies must come first. We took the only road we felt was open to
us. A job in a small country town, sadly six hundred miles away from a much
loved family. We bought (or we and the bank bought) a huge old weatherboard
house on two blocks of land on the very edge of town.
  We set to work and dug up most of the back yard only to discover that
Glen Innes was in the middle of a severe drought.

<h> The Writings of Thick+thorn </h>

<bl> by Glen Ingram </bl>

  Last century, natural history was popular - very popular. In Aus+tralia,
like most countries in the west+ern world, the writings of naturalists were
in demand and avidly read. But unlike in Europe, very few popular books about
the natural world were printed in the Australian colonies. There is, however,
a vast endemic literature. Unfortunately, it is hidden from most of us because
it is in news+papers. If we are to discover a tra+dition of Australian natural
history writing, we must look to those old periodicals.
  Here lies a paradox. Because news+papers were ephemeral, their contents
influenced few. Books would have created a tradition, but their numbers
were lacking. It is no accident that a native naturalistic writing, like
Aus+tralian science, had to be reinvented in the 1950s. But that is the
lot of a country with a colonial past.
  I would like to introduce you to `Thickthorn', my favourite writer of
natural history of yore. He wrote for newspapers in the 1880s. His style
was attractive: rich phrases moulded with spirit but marked with the hard
edge of empiricism. His description of the nest of the White-throated War+bler,
for example:

  <note> quote </note>

`Thickthorn' was the nom-de-plume of Charles Walter Devis. Devis was born
in Birmingham, England, in 1829. After completing a Bachelor of Arts at
Cambridge, he entered the Church of England and became the Rector of Brecon
in Somersetshire. Eventually, he left the church to be+come curator of the
Queens Park Mu+seum in Manchester. In 1870, he de+parted England and settled
at Rock+hampton in the colony of Queensland. There he wrote his articles
as `Thick+thorn' in the tradition of the classic English clergyman-naturalists,
a class which flourished in the nineteenth century.
  One contemporary writer high+lighted the advantages of combining theology
with natural history:

  <note> quote </note>

But what attracted clergymen, and indeed what made natural history so
popular across all class barriers, was Natural Theology. Its principles
were persuasive. Nature was the Creation of God and in Nature one could
see His Workings. The living kingdom exhibited His Perfection and His Spirit.
By observing Nature and at+tempting to understand the Creation, one came
closer to God.
  The spirit of natural theology per+meated Thickthorn's writing:

  <note> quote </note>

The spirit was in his writings but God wasn't. Thickthorn was a con+vinced
Darwinist. Even so, the essays of Thickthorn are a cogent argument against
the proposition that Darwin killed spirit. Certainly evolution killed natural
theology. Observing nature had led to a theory that seriously chal+lenged
the idea of creation. Natural history had become dangerous. It was no longer
a respectable pastime.
  The writings of `Thickthorn' are also a foil against the proposition that
to write scientifically as a naturalist one must write coldly. Science,
like natural history, is a world of wonder, curiosity, and imagination.
Watch `Thickthorn' as he first encounters the burrowing habits of nesting
Black+headed Pardolates:

  <note> quote </note>

`Thickthorn' wrote his last natural history article in The Queenslander
on 18 March, 1882. But for Charles de Vis at 53, a new career was just
be+ginning. He changed his name to de Vis, switched to straight scientific
prose, and took the position of Curator at the infant Queensland Museum.
In the next thirty years he wrote about 200 papers and described and named
several hundred species of vertebrates from Australia and New Guinea. The
animals for which he is best remem+bered are Bennett's Tree-Kangaroo, the
Golden Bowerbird, McGregor's Bowerbird, the Spiny Rainforest Skink, and the
Red-eyed Treefrog.
  The death of `Thickthorn' and the birth of `de Vis' was a gain for science.
But it was a loss for natural history. What is sadder, however, is that
you, the reader, have little opportunity to read `Thickthorn's' writings.
Perhaps it is best not to lament. The 1880s were very different from the
1980s. You might be annoyed by the misin+formation, stunned by the opinions,
and enraged by the shooter-mentality.

<h> Telling Tales on Turkeys </h>

<bl> by Darryl Jones </bl>

  The floor of a rainforest is a fertile and verdant metropolis, a shim+mering
world where life teems among layers of decay. It is the largest of the citizens
of the rainforest floor that has drawn me into this twilight world, a bird
whose method of breeding gives it a particularly intimate link with the riches
of the leaf litter: the Australian Brush-turkey.
  Stalking these sagacious creatures in the quiet of their rainforest home
re+quires patience, alertness and one's greatest abilities of observation.
More practically, the bed of leaves needs to be damp and an indifference
to insect assailants is also essential. Today the leaves are crisp; every
twig snaps under the boot. No Pademelon or Pitta will ignore this clumsy
intruder this morning. Mostly glimpses are all I see; the scuttle and panic
of shy ani+mals in flight, or the momentary stare of some defiant inhabitant
outraged at the blatancy of this intrusion. So often our style of inquiry into
nature offers only a transitory view, of disturbance and disrupted routines, 
adequate for a check-list but unsatisfactory for a closer insight into secret 
lives.
  A solution to such disruptions is, simply, to hide! And the best way of
assuring that there is always a hiding place is to provide your own. A good
length of hessian wrapped around three or four saplings serves very well.
It's cheap, light and easy to relocate. This one is serving its third (and
last) season, judging by the ex+tent of the mildew and rot. Inside I sweep
the leaves from the seat, sit and squint through one of the little win+dows.
  Though my passing has scattered some of the early risers, the disruption
is soon forgotten in the urgency of the dawn call to exuberance. My
disap+pearance and silence as non-existence is soon evident in the continuity
of the life all around me.

The slight `crunch ... crunch' of feet on the carpet of leaves causes eye
to defer to ear; a regular `thump ...thump ... thump', usually in threes
quiet and even, is the Noisy Pitta. A louder, quite abandoned tossing of
leaves, this way, then that, relentless, busy and single minded: the Southern
Logrunner. Also loud, industrious and even more explosive is the Whipbird,
casting aside great feetfuls of leaves.
  But only one creature has the steady, purposeful stride of that ap+proaching.
I sit up and take pencil and notebook to hand, noting time and place and
hence return to the practical necessities involved in this type of dis+covery.
  A large Brush-turkey has stopped on the edge of the area in front of the
hide. I silently swat the trio of mos+quitoes sitting on the back of my
hand and lean forward to get a better view through the window.
  I note the bright yellow wattle swinging at the base of his deep red,
naked neck (` ... adult male ...'); then read the plastic wing tag. Once
white, for males, a year of dust bath+ing in the rich red rainforest soil
has stained the tag to a dark maroon. However, I can still read the number:
5 white is Cecil.
  A little more than a month ago Cecil, along with a small number of the
older males of this location began the arduous task of constructing the
massive compost heap they have learned to use as an incubator for their
eggs. For up to six hours on many days, Cecil raked all of the leaf litter
from a wide area towards a growing pile. As the huge pile grew the leaves
in the damp interior began to ferment. After about three weeks the internal
temperatures had risen to well over 40$degrees;C before slowly declining and 
eventually stabilising at around 33$degrees;C. From then on, having moved perhaps 
three tonnes of leaf litter and soil, Cecil's energies were turned to the task of 
guarding his castle from poss+ible take-overs by other males, and to await the 
arrival of the females!
  It was about two weeks ago that all of this labour, this careful and costly
investment in his future was lost to Cecil. His closest neighbour, the
se+cretive and despotic Wallace, having chosen his moment carefully after
the main toil was over, usurped Cecil in a series of mighty tussles. Cecil
then re+treated deeper into the forest and im+mediately started constructions
again. Wallace thereby added Cecil's mound to his own real estate and set
about pa+trolling both mounds.
                                                           
Cecil's forlorn revisit to his original mound is short lived. A deep, resonant
`mmoo-oo-oom' announces the arrival of his victor. Cecil, his wattle with+drawn
to a small cravat out of reluc+tant respect, rapidly retreats into the forest
depths. Wallace regally ascends to the top of his new mound without losing a
definite composure, the mas+ter of all he surveys.
  Unlike most other avians, and even their closest kin, these peculiar fowl have a
domestic arrangement all their own. Whereas the other Australian mound builders,
the Mallee Fowl and the tropical Scrubfowl, regard mon+ogamy as sacrosanct, the
Turkeys hold much more libertine views. Liaisons between the sexes are fre+quent
but brief. Besides the brief period necessary for mating, time spent together is
limited to that required for egg laying. There are no pairs as such, and although a
particu+lar female may visit a certain male re+peatedly one could hardly describe
the relationship as a bond. Some females can visit up to three males during the
season. The males however, bound by their decision to guard their estates, must
remain at home and hope for a visit. Some make it, most don't and usually give up
fairly soon.
  Wallace has stood atop his ill gained castle, fidgety and nervous, making the
occasional rake at the surface. The transformation to a regal male, swag+gering and
strutting, pecking effectedly at the mound surface is dra+matic. Yes, quietly and
unobtrusively, a female has edged into the arena be+fore me. Only by this
exaggerated sub+missive stance, neck withdrawn and all movements slow, does she
escape the usual violent expulsion Wallace issues to all other intruders. Iris, her
once yellow wing-tags also stained to orange, walks diffidently up the es+carpment
of the mound. Wallace con+tinues to pace up and down, pecking, posing, until Iris'
mien suddenly changes. From apparent submission to flagrant flirtation, she spreads
her wings and fluffs out her body feathers: the message is unequivocal to Wallace.
They mate, briefly and per+functorily.
  Iris recovers instantly. No longer either flirtatious or coy, she is now a hen of
resolve and purposefully sets about raking and digging in the top of the mound. She
has an egg to lay, the result of another union of some days previously. (Whether
this egg is Wallace's is something I cannot say, but neither, I suspect, can
Wallace.)
  Wallace, having recovered from his rush of passion, now sees before him only an
intruder and an audacious one. He proceeds to cuff and peck Iris. She, shielding
herself with an upheld wing, digs determinedly*determindly on. Wallace's
har+rassment continues. Twice he succeeds in driving her from the large hole she is
digging but she is soon back to her thankless task. Only when she is obvi+ously
settling down to lay does he cease his attacks, and even appears to take some
interest in the activity. Iris is now almost entirely hidden within the hole,
having dug down to a depth that satisfied her numerous tempera+ture probes. The
mouthful at about 40 cm seemed to be about right.
  She finally emerges after some min+utes of silence, another of her huge eggs in
place, firmly positioned by carefully treading in the damp, warm earth around it.
This egg is only one of perhaps thirty she may lay this season, a total weight of
which comes to about three times her own body weight. She leaves soon after, sent
on her way finally with another savage charge by an unsentimental Wallace. He
returns to his domain, fussily filling in the hole and generally tidying up.

Wallace eventually leaves the mound to feed for the first time at around 8 o'clock,
a full three hours after he rose.

<h> Floating giants </h>

  Icebergs originate from the calving events of floating ice at the seaward
boundary of outlet glaciers and ice shelves. The thick ice of the Antarctic
interior, flowing constantly outwards under its own enormous weight, converges
into fast-moving outlet glaciers at the continental margin. As the ice
protrudes into surrounding waters, the effect of buoyancy causes further
spreading and thinning, forming floating ice tongues or ice shelves. Bending
stresses, caused by waves and swell, soon extract their toll and icebergs
are born.
  Since the days of the earliest polar explorers, Antarctic icebergs have
thrilled writers and photographers, terrorised mariners, fascinated civilian
and military engineers, and tempted tourists, yet they've all but been ignored
by scientists until relatively recent times.
  Icebergs (huge frozen masses of fresh water) are a common feature of both
Arctic and Antarctic oceans. However, Antartic icebergs are generally much
larger, colder and more numerous than their Arctic equivalents. For example,
whereas a `very large' Arctic iceberg might meas+ure 750 x 350 x 30 metres
in length, breadth and thickness, a `very large' Antarctic iceberg could
measure 1,500 x 750 x 400 metres. With these dimen+sions, it would weigh
up to 400 million tonnes - almost the entire annual water consumption for
the city of Melbourne - and have a freeboard (height above water) equal to
that of a ten story building (freeboard for tabular icebergs being typically
15 per cent of their total thickness). Of all the icebergs in the Southern
Ocean, those over 1,000 metres in width ('width' be+ing the maximum horizontal
dimen+sion at waterline) comprise only about four per cent by count, yet 51 per
cent by volume. Most Antartic icebergs, however, are less than 500 metres in width,
with the largest numbers (more than a third of all sightings) being in the size 
range of 50 to 200 metres.
  Imagine the mixture of terror and enchantment that must have 'shivered
the timbers' of early explorers, who, in flimsy and sometimes ill-equipped
sail+ing vessels, dared to probe Antarctic waters in search of the 'southern
conti+nent'. One of the earliest of these ex+plorers, to whom polar regions
were not unfamiliar, was Captain James Cook. For Cook, the hazards of sailing
among icebergs were not taken light+ly. On his second voyage of discovery
(1772-1775), Cook (in the HMS Reso+lution) circumnavigated the globe at
an approximate latitude of 60&degrees;S, cross+ing the Antarctic circle on three
occa+sions but without actually sighting the mysterious continent they had
hoped to discover. He notes:
  "...About noon came close under the above mentioned island of ice and were by
a kind of indraught or some means or other insensibly sucked so near that
we had scarce any probabili+ty of escaping being drove against it which
must have been inevitable de+struction and it was equally as un+known almost
how we got off without and we scarce got a cables length from it..."
  In the 20th century, icebergs have occasionally created news. The sinking
in 1912 of the HMS Titanic, for exam+ple, was caused by the collision with
a relatively small iceberg off the coast of Newfoundland, Canada. The
stagger+ing loss of 1,513 lives, making it one of the worst maritime disasters
in the his+tory of mankind, jolted maritime authorities into organising
the first 'In+ternational Convention for Safety of Life at Sea'. This resulted
in the in+troduction of safety measures (today taken for granted), such
as a place in a lifeboat for each person embarked, lifeboat drills to be
held during the voyage and a compulsory 24-hour radio watch.

<h> Distribution and Dissolution </h>

  A traditional method used to col+lect information on iceberg distribu+tions
during Australian National Antarctic Research Expeditions has been shipboard
observations, both vis+ual and radar, within a 12 nautical mile radius of
the ship. Icebergs sizes are es+timated and the numbers within desig+nated
size categories recorded in a logbook with latitude, longitude, wa+ter
temperature, sea-ice concentration and any other relevant information. Detailed
size measurements are gathered for tabular icebergs and the more northerly
pinnacled icebergs. In these cases iceberg height and width are measured
trigonometrically, using a sextant to obtain the subtended an+gle, in
conjunction with a distance ob+tained by radar.
  Satellite surveillance is at present not capable of monitoring iceberg
movement and decay, except for gigantic icebergs larger than say ten kilometres
in width. Typical problems incurred using satellites include obscu+ration
by cloud, difficulty in distin+guishing between sea-ice and icebergs, limited
resolution and cover+age, and difficulty recognising the same iceberg(s)
again after breakage or rollover has occurred.
  The mechanisms by which freely floating icebergs are reduced from large
to small are as yet not fully un+derstood, although they are known to be
a combination of breakage, calving around the edges and subsurface melt.
Melt plays a relatively minor part in the dissolution of large icebergs
al+though it becomes the major mechan+ism in the dissolution of smaller,
blocky icebergs. The speed of subsur+face melt is easier to appreciate when
you realise that typical Southern Ocean water temperatures are around +1&deg;C.
Melting of the above water por+tion by the Sun's direct radiation also has
a negligible effect on iceberg dis+solution. Generally, the meltwater so
produced percolates down into snow and firn (compacted snow) layers and simply
refreezes.
  The effect of rollover tends to en+hance all of the above dissolution processes, 
particularly subsurface melting. Icebergs have been observed to roll over abruptly,
although the spectacle is one that few are privileged to witness. Rollover will 
occur when, after breakage and melting, the thick+ness of an iceberg becomes less 
than or equal to the width. Sometimes ice+bergs may 'turn turtle' (180&degrees;), 
although a roll of less than 90&degrees; is more com+mon. Rollover is the primary 
factor re+sponsible for pinnacles - caused by thrusting edges or corners high into 
the air. When an iceberg `rolls' it rev+eals a characteristic smooth and rounded 
underwater shape. Normally a wave notch is visible, marking the position of the 
previous waterline. Sometimes the waterline may be stained green from algae, 
although this is uncommon. Rollover can also identify those icebergs that have 
sedi+ment layers embedded in the icemass. Particle matter in the ice and sediment 
from the sea floor can give rise to the appearance of black or dark green icebergs.
  Large tabular bergs, freshly calved from glaciers or iceshelves, may last
for a period of years if they either run aground or remain in waters close
to the Antarctic coast. Here the surface water is extremely cold, which
minimises melt. More importantly, however, the presence of sea-ice dampens
the swell and produces a flat sea, devoid of wave action. This en+vironment
is one in which there are minimal bending stresses or erosion forces,
responsible for the dissolution processes of breakage and calving.
  The deep draught (portion below water) of Antarctic icebergs causes them
to drift in the direction of aver+age current movement. Icebergs, un+like
sea-ice, are not greatly affected by winds or irregular surface currents.
Bergs will simply rip through sea-ice like tissue paper if the overall current
is at variance to the top few metres of the watermass.
  Large tabular icebergs are known to have travelled tens of thousands of
kilometres in westerly moving cur+rents of Antarctic coastal flow (that is, around
the coast over the continental shelf). Icebergs tracked by satellite
transponder have shown typical speeds of up to half a knot.
  Size distributions of icebergs flow+ing in the easterly-moving Antarctic
circumpolar current have been stud+ied statistically to determine life
ex+pectancy. Analysis has shown that for icebergs less than 1,000 metres
in width a 'median-life' of about 0.2 years may be expected. (The term
median-life refers to the time taken for half of the icebergs in one particular
size cate+gory to be reduced to half of their original numbers by breakage
into smaller sizes.) This means that a medi+um iceberg of 350 metres width
could be expected to last between six months and two years before all traces
of the original berg are destroyed. Esti+mates of life expectancy are
necessari+ly imprecise because of the fact that icebergs, like human beings,
come in all manner of consistency, quality and shape.
  Recent studies of Antarctic ice+berg distributions have shown that the
common northerly limit seems rough+ly linked to the average maximum ex+tent
of Antarctic sea-ice at about latitude 59&degrees;S. One might be forgiven, however,
in thinking that the Antarctic convergence (or polar front), at lati+tude
51&degrees;S in the Australian region, would have delineated the absolute northern
boundary of icebergs, since this is where a sharp temperature difference
occurs between the cooler waters of the Southern Ocean and the warmer oceans
of mid latitudes.
  Sightings of icebergs north of the Antarctic convergence are relatively rare, 
however on 15 January 1982, two icebergs were sighted at 48&degrees;S,
111&degrees;E - only about 1,800 kilometres south of Perth. These icebergs were 
al+most certainly the remnants of a gigan+tic iceberg and may have come from as 
far away as the Weddell Sea, more than 13,000 kilometres to the west. Icebergs at 
these latitudes were well known to the captains of the clipper ships who, after
rounding the Cape of Good Hope on their way to Australia, would have had
to weigh up the risks of steering further south to pick up the strong westerly
trade winds versus the increased likelihood of disastrous en+counters with
icebergs.

<h> Reflections in Ice </h>

  Perhaps on the next occasion you find yourself lounging in a reclining
chair and sipping a cool lemon-squash, you might like to reflect, finally,
on why the ice blocks in your drink have so much less freeboard than that
ob+served for tabular icebergs.
  The answer to this question is twofold. First, the iceberg is floating
in salt water and therefore has slightly more buoyancy. But second, and
more importantly, most of the above-water portion of a tabular iceberg is
in fact snow or firn with a density much less than that of ice. A typical
thick+ness to freeboard ratio for tabular ice+bergs is about 6 or 7:1 although
for irregular icebergs this ratio is more likely to be about 2 or 3:1.
  Icebergs are a fascinating phenomenon and a surprising amount can be learned
about them by simply watching an ice cube melt and roll over in a glass
of water!

<h> Formulating the future </h>

  Many would like to see the Antarctic set aside, one way or another, as
a continent free from development or exploitation of any kind.
  Humanity's history of discovery, explora+tion and eventual exploitation
has seen waves of people move from their native land to inhabit what were
for a long time seen as uninhabitable regions. Two hund+red years ago, white
man moved into Aust+ralia shortly after moving into southern Africa. We
are now showing signs of moving into space, the deep sea and Antartica.
  What are the possible resources available in Antartica? Although little
hope of exploitation exists realistically in the near future, some
possibilities do exist in the medium to long-term future, particularly fisheries
(being ten+tatively developed now), ice (as a water source), minerals
(including hydrocarbons), tourism and what I term serendipity - the unexpected
results of research.
  In discussing the future it is also worth considering the impact on
Ant+arctica of mankind's activities else+where on the globe.

<h> Ice as a Water Source </h>

  Antarctica contains 25-30 million cubic kilometres of ice, enough to raise
the sea level by some 70 metres should it melt. It sheds some 12,000-14,000
cubic kilometres per year as icebergs, with a water purity far in excess
of normal distilled water.
  There has been much popular speculation about the potential role of icebergs
as a water source, most centring on the concept of towing ice+bergs to the
site of water need.
  A 30 million tonne iceberg is at the larger end of the medium-sized ice+berg
range and contains about .04 cubic kilometres of ice, enough water to serve the
needs of a city the size of Perth for seven to eight weeks in summer. That
amount of water is worth some $14-15 million in Perth or $18 million in
Adelaide. Both cities perceive a need for additional water for both water
supply and quality con+trol.
