Snow food for all tastes  

EATING out at Mt Buller this season will cost only about $1 more than last
year.
  The mountain has 24 first-class restaurants and bars offering a variety
of meals, from quick snacks for skiers on the go, to cosy, candlelit dinners.
  Hungry hordes will find hearty meals of pasta, homemade pastries, spit
roast, seafood and Chinese.
  Anyone who has ever been to Mt Buller will have heard of, if not eaten
at, the Abominable Snowman, known as the Abom.
  The Abom's strawberry pancakes are renowned throughout Australia and are
always a highlight of a ski holiday feast. 
  They will again be on the menu this year priced around $4, along with
huge bowls of spaghetti for about $5.
  At the middle of the cost scale is Alpine Retreat on Sterling Rd.
  The restaurant is licensed and host Carl Mattern has been known to pour
out more than his fair share of complimentary drinks.
  Son Danny said a three course meal would cost about $15 this year. 
  Another popular restaurant, Breathtaker, will serve main dishes priced
about $17.50.
  Breathtaker's food is always delightful and the restaurant oozes class.
  The Arlberg at the top of Bourke St has three eating areas - Nooky's spit
grill restaurant, Albies and the bistro.
  Main meals will cost around $13.  Albies is a sort of brasserie, with
coffee and bagels for lunch and Albie cocktails and pancakes in the afternoon.
 Supper is served from 11 pm to 3 am.
  The Arlberg bistro is always jammed full at lunchtime.  Meals are quick
to go and prices won't break the bank.
  Hans Grimus, who runs the Pension Grimus, is a well-known identity.  If
you dine with him be sure to ask to try his "snuff."
  Main meals are priced around $14 at the Pension Grimus, with children's
meals also available.
