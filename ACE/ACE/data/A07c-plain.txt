C'wealth outshines rival banks with record $289.2m  

  THE Commonwealth Bank Group boosted profit 21.5 per cent from $238.09
million to a record $289.2 million in the June 30 year.
  The result compares well with the half-yearly results of the other major
banks and largely flowed from higher levels of business and a slight widening
of interest margins on lending.
  Pre-tax profit rose 24 per cent from $359.5 million to $445.5 million,
while profit after tax and extraordinary items was $277.4 million, up 17
per cent on $237 million previously.
  Managing director, Vern Christie, said the results reflected the bank's
increased volume of offshore borrowings and assets, tight control of
costs and strong earnings from the foreign exchange division.
  The Commonwealth is now the second largest currency dealer by volume after
Westpac.
  The bank also received a $110 million dividend from its wholly-owned
susidiary, the Commonwealth Savings Bank, up from $30 million last year,
but this was not included in group profit.
  The Federal Government has claimed a record $100.5 million dividend from
the group, up from $22.6 million last year.
  The 1985-86 group result compares favourably with the National Australia
Bank's half yearly profit which was up 5.9 per cent to $153.4 million after
a record 30.1 percent rise to $301.7 million in the full year to September
30, 1985.
  The ANZ's interim profit was down 6.9 per cent to $141.9 million after
a 12.8 per cent rise to $283.0 million for the full year previously.
  Westpac posted a 5.8 per cent rise to $196.1 million after a 20.2 per
cent annual rise to $367.6 million.
  Mr Christie said the bank could not expect to maintain the 1985-86 profit
growth rate in 1986-87.
  Productivity rose from $7299 of profit produced by each employee in 1984-85
to $8668 for each of the 33,364 employees in 1985-86.
  Retail deposits increased only 5.5 per cent, or $1,035 million, in the
12 months, attributed entirely to the general deposit downturn in the banking
sector prior to the introduction of the housing package on April 2.
  Total deposits with the group rose 8.9 per cent to $23.1 billion.
  The savings deposit downturn held the Commonwealth Savings Bank's
contribution to group profit to $115.5 million, up only 3 per cent.
  Home lending totalled $2.17 billion in 1985-86 with $2.4 billion allocated
this year.
  Mr Christie was optimistic interest rates would decline in early 1987,
but said it was unlikely lower rates would flow through to home mortgages
without long-term stability in the Australian currency.
