Cover story in reverse for clad Amanda You can't tell a woman by her clothes By Gail Williams  

  CLOTHES, like manners, may maketh man, but Amanda Muggleton has discovered
they can turn a wellknown Australian actress into a nonentity.
  The former Prisoner star was swamped in publicity in 1983, when Perth
audiences swarmed to Her Majesty's Theatre to see her wearing just a towel,
in Steaming.
  She says her phone didn't stop ringing and the media made a huge fuss
of her.  But she's finding things a lot quieter playing Pauline, in The
Secret Diary of Adrian Mole, at the Regal Theatre.
  The show is a roaring success, but Amanda says if she kept a diary during
her six-week stint in Perth it would read like this:
  "MONDAY:  My one day off.  Phone didn't ring, no interviews.  Went down
to Fremantle and sat in the sun.
  TUESDAY:  Browsed around the Art Gallery, loved the Golden Summers
exhibition  The show brought the house down again.
  "WEDNESDAY:  Did a matinee, good attendance.  Not sure if the audience
got the message about Pauline's awakening.  No interviews.  Cast went to
Gobbles, F Scotts and Rumors after the show.
  "THURSDAY:  Full house, no interviews.  Am looking forward to going to
Rottnest.  Hope I'm not seasick like I was last time.  No interviews, maybe
I should take my clothes off!
  "FRIDAY:  Lady from the Sunday Times phoned.  Perhaps she heard I'm taking
my clothes off!
  Don't get Amanda wrong.  She's not going out of her way to seek publicity.
 She's just noticed Perth theatregoers are more fickle than those in the
east.
  Said Amanda:  "I think it's really weird, because last time I came here
I got such a different reception.  I would hate to think it was just because
I took my clothes off.  If that's what it takes to sell a show it's pretty
poor, don't you think?
  "In Melbourne, the show was received really well and given huge amounts
of publicity.  Here it's being received just as well, but the press don't
seem to want to know.  In Perth, I haven't been doing an awful lot apart
from the show.  I suppose you could say my whole life is spent in the
darkness of the theatre."
  Since Amanda charmed Perth audiences as the voluptuous Josie, in Steaming,
she has made three movies, and travelled through South-east Asia and China.
  "I did the movies Street Hero, with Siggy (Thornton) and Queen of the
Road with Shane Withington from A Country Practice," she said.
  When Prisoner's final episode comes up in September, Amanda will join
her former co-stars in drinking a final toast to the end of one of Australia's
most popular soapies.  But she won't shed a tear.
  I'll probably never do another soap opera," she said.  "With soaps you
get labelled as your character, not only by the public, but by people in
the industry.
  "While I was doing Prisoner I came close to getting a role in a miniseries,
but I didn't get it because the public would have identified me with Chrissie
Latham from Prisoner.
  "The stupid thing is, people doling out the work tend to look down on
soap actors because they are churning out quantity, not quality.  If only
they realised what soap operas are doing to actors - they're improving
them by making them act so much better to improve the dreadful scripts."
  Amanda, no shrinking violet, always seems to be cast in the role of the
gutsy women.
  "I've been very lucky really," she said.  "I love those roles.  I've never
had to play the ingenue, the frail heart always in tears - that's not me.
 I adore Pauline.  A lot of women are going through exactly the same things
she's experiencing.  They're torn between two worlds, the world of duty
and that of the liberated woman."
  There's a smidgeon of the flirtatious Pauline, in Amanda's bubbly
personality.  But the awakening feminist in Pauline is no stranger to Amanda.
  "I think I have myself very much together, as far as women's lib goes,"
she said.
  "I've no desire to get married or have children at this stage.
  "I seem to be surrounded by men at the moment in my personal life. 
All of them want to get married and have babies.
  "In the past, it has been the woman who wanted all of that.  Now women
are realising, like Pauline, what they have been missing out on.  Young
girls today are thinking they want to do everything but get married.
  "It's crazy - the women's liberation movement has made men want to have
the security of a wife."
  While she's in Perth, Amanda hopes to catch up with one of her greatest
fans, Monica, from Rocky Bay Village.  They met during Appealathon two
years ago.  Monica was the Appealathon child and they write regularly.
