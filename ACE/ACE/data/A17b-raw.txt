	<h> Police break nurses' pickets </h>

  POLICE have started escorting hospital supply trucks after clashes at nurses'
picket lines at the weekend.
  Nurses and supporters were dragged from a picket line after trucks carrying
clean linen for about 20 hospitals were blocked at the central linen service
at the Royal Melbourne Hospital.
  Police also broke a picket line at the Freemasons' Private Hospital to
allow deliveries of clean linen.
  The lights of a truck were damaged when a car was used to stop trucks
leaving the central linen service, and police said they would take action
against a protester.
  Picketing nurses were joined by other union members at the weekend.
  The Royal Australian Nursing Federation state secretary, Ms Irene Bolger,
said yesterday police had acted violently and without reason.
  Miss Bolger will meet the ACTU secretary, Mr Bill Kelty, on the RANF's
20 wage and career structure claims after a mass meeting of nurses today.
  &quot;The ACTU will be of some assistance in speaking to the State Government
but their involvement will not solve this dispute overnight,&quot; Ms Bolger
said.
  She said the nurses would give the Government a clear message of defiance
at the mass meeting by continuing the strike.
  Ms Bolger said the RANF wages claim withdrawn from the State Industrial
Commission last week had not been abandoned and could be re-submitted and
in an altered form.
  A full bench of the commission will resume hearing the Hospital Employees'
Federation  (No 1 branch) claim for the restructuring of junior nurses'
wages and career structure today.
  The Treasurer, Mr Jolly, said yesterday the RANF had adopted an incoherent
and inconsistent approach to resolving the 32-day strike.
