BLASTHOLE DENSITY LOGGING AS AN AID TO BLAST PATTERN DESIGN By PETER G BELLAIRS, IAN SHEPPARD AND JOHN BULTERS ABSTRACT  

  Two blasthole density logging programmes have been conducted on the Mt
Whaleback iron ore mine to evaluate the use of this type of logging as an
aid to blast pattern design. The first programme also involved the setting
up of a Density Test facility with which to calibrate the density probe.
The programmes indicated that about 22-23 blastholes can be consistently
logged per day at a cost of $1.30 per metre. Even though this is only half
the rate required to log the average number of blastholes drilled daily
on Mt Whaleback, testwork indicated that no significant loss of accuracy
results if only half the holes in a pattern are logged. The major results
of the programmes were:-

  

  These density results have been used to implement savings in drilling
and blasting via pattern expansion and charge optimisation of blastholes.
Eight ore patterns have been successfully fired and dug using 2 m less Ammonium
Nitrate Fuel Oil explosive (ANFO) in the blast damaged front row blastholes
instead of the standard 1 m drop in charge from the main body blastholes.

  The low densities recorded in shales and BIF have led to pattern expansions
of up to 50%. Further experimentation is being undertaken to justify further
pattern expansion for all waste on Mt Whaleback. Pattern expansion
experimentation is also being undertaken in the softer ores. Currently,
an 11 m equilateral triangle pattern is used to blast these rock types although
a 16 m by 10 m pattern has successfully fired some soft high grade ore.

  The geophysical logging of blastholes, provides a low cost method of providing
density data with which to base and monitor blast pattern design
experimentation, alter powder factors and accurately locate charges within
blastholes.

      INTRODUCTION  

  This paper details the methods used and the overall results obtained from
two blasthole geophysical logging programmes conducted by Century Geophysical
Logging Australia on Mt Whaleback. The first programme was carried out over
27 January to 31 March 1985 and was part time in nature being combined with
the geophysical logging of both percussion and diamond holes.
