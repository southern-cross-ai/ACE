	<h> BOY STILL ON WALKABOUT </h>
	

THERE is still no sign of Vaucluse schoolboy James Wolfe, who may be wandering
Sydney with amnesia.
  James, 15, who suffers from epilepsy and needs regular medication, went
walking last Thursday and did not return home.
  Since then there have been sightings in the eastern suburbs and in the
City.
  Last December James, paddling on a surf ski in the Harbour, failed to come
home and was presumed drowned, but next day he was found paddling the ski
west of the Harbour Bridge and returned home unhurt.
