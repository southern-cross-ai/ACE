Footy star tells of lost $6000  

FORMER VFL footballer Phil Carman lost his $6000 deposit on a frozen chicken
and egg sales venture, the County Court was told yesterday.
  Carman, 35, a sub-contractor of Bendigo, said he agreed to buy the franchise
in 1980 after reading an advertisement he could earn between $350 and $400
a week.
  He said he paid the deposit for what he believed was the sole Ferntree
Gully franchise to sell Victoria Egg Board eggs.
  Robert Ashley Lewis, 42, of Minchinbury Drive, Vermont South, has pleaded
not guilty to 41 counts of obtaining property by deception and two counts
of attempting to obtain property by deception between January 1979 and
September, 1983.
  The trial is not finished.
