Where are the bears? By TIM BOREHAM  

WHAT has happened to all the bearish talk of a much-vaunted second recession,
to equal the pessimism of 1982-83?
  It seems that despite perennial gloom about high interest rates, the current
account deficit and the state of the Australian dollar, the present "bull
run" seen in our stock markets at the moment is going to continue for some
time.
