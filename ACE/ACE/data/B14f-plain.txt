A false alarm signal  

  Vanuatu's decision to establish diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union
will be taken by many in Australia as an alarm signal. It will confirm their
view that Moscow is embarked on a long-term strategy to penetrate the South
Pacific politically so as to dominate it strategically. As support for their
argument, they will note the recent fishing agreement signed by Kiribati
with the Soviet Union and the similar commercial deal planned by Vanuatu
with the Russians. Soviet trawlers, according to this cautionary thesis,
will serve also as spy ships and prepare the way for fully-armed warships.
  Before considering whether such a reaction is realistic or merely an
over-reaction, it needs to be noted that Vanuatu or any other Pacific nation
has an unchallengeable right to arrange diplomatic links with any country
it chooses. The Pacific nations are no longer colonies obliged to subvert
their own preferences or interests to those of their imperial rulers.
This would seem self-evident but, judging from some of the statements
emerging from official Washington, it does not yet seem to have been accepted
fully by the US. One illustration of this unfortunate mental block is
provided by overbearing behavior of the American Tuna Boat Association
in its refusal to pay the Pacific islanders for fishing rights. It is that
refusal, supported by the US Government, which has persuaded Kiribati and
Vanuatu to turn to the Russians, who are willing to pay.
  On present evidence, we have no reason to believe that these Soviet fishing
deals are other than legitimate commercial operations. The Russians need
the fish to help feed the big Soviet population; the islanders need the
cash to help their fragile economies.
