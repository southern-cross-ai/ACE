Believably versatile By John Parker  

  If you want to make people laugh in Australia these days, you have to
be versatile.
  That's the case on the live circuit.
  Vince Sorrenti is a classic example of versatility - he knows, even down
to the expressions he uses, he must be ready to adjust.
  "I can work clean or I can work dirty," the `unbelievable!' Vince said.
  "It doesn't worry me.
  "It's different courses for different places.
  "You can't get up in a pub full of screaming yobbos and recite poetry.
  "If you don't use a bit of colorful language in the first two words, they're
not going to listen to you."
  But, as long as all bases are covered, it seems a good comedian can do
alright.
  Sorrenti is making a decent living from his career which no doubt will
be boosted by the release of his first album, aptly titled Unbelievable!
  Even the album reflects versatility.
  Side one is taken from live gigs, complete with crowd responses and throw
away lines.
  Side two is studio based, which Sorrenti believes adds a little more scope
for the creative comedian.
  It includes such formidable epics as a rugby match between Wales and
the PLO, which would be difficult to reproduce live.
  He even launches into song on the album.
  For those who have not yet caught Sorrenti in the act, he is playing at
Adelaide's Flying Trapeze tonight, tomorrow and Saturday.
