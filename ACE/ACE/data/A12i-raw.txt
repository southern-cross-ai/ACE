	<h> Buildings to be used for education </h>
	

  Buildings at Watson High School are likely to continue to be used for
educational purposes after the school's closure at the end of next year.
  The Minister for Education, Senator Ryan, said in a statement yesterday
that the school was &quot;valuable public property&quot; and that it was &quot;desirable
that it continues to provide some form of educational service&quot;.
  Senator Ryan did not detail what the school could be used for but said
it would be decided after talks with the ACT Teachers' Federation and other
interested parties.
  The president of the federation, Mr Peter O'Connor, said yesterday that
it was &quot;encouraging&quot; that Senator Ryan wanted the buildings used for
educational purposes.
