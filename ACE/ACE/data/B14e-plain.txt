Black Tuesday  

  Australia will watch with fascination the campaign, launched yesterday,
to raise a $10m Australian Farmers' Fighting Fund, some of which will be
directed to attacking the Federal Government's economic policies.
  With the dubbing by businesses of yesterday as Black Tuesday - the day
some extraordinary new tax laws came into effect - an obvious target will
be the fringe benefits tax. This tax, arising from the first of three options
for reform which the Treasurer, Mr Keating, put to the tax summit a year
ago, has a rough modicum of justice in seeking to tax backdoor pay given
in the form of perks. Few could oppose the principle; but the Government
has singularly failed to distinguish between taxable rorts and legitimate
and even essential benefits, and it has further been clumsy with
administration and collection.
  Some time must be given for businesses - those which adapt rather than
whinge - to come to terms with the changes. But already we can see that
the implications of the fringe benefits tax are more complicated and dangerous
than has been suspected.
  Businesses may well seek administrative ease by eventually phasing out
anything remotely resembling a benefit, and this would threaten the accord
and industrial harmony. And as it stands now, the tax lowers productivity
by wasting human resources, inhibits enterprise and positively invites
the Australian personality to seek more ingenious ways of tax evasion.
  It may be futile to expect the Government, at this stage, to reconsider
the tax, even when faced with the new-found muscle of the farmers. But tax
officials might help us by issuing complete and comprehensible guides to
just how nasty and extensive the fringe benefits tax is going to be. And
the Treasurer might take courage in his hands and reassess the possibility
of selling again to the people the alternative Option C for a broadly based
consumption tax.
