BOWLER'S BEST CAVALRY'S ALL CLASS by GLENN ROBBINS  

EXCITING three-year-old Cavalry has a devoted fan in the VRC handicapper
Jim Bowler.
 The lightly raced Cavalry emerged as a top prospect at Flemington when
he won the 1100m Black Douglas Stakes on November 1 and a 1400m welter the
following Saturday.
  "I thought Cavalry was one of the top three three-year-olds to come out
of our Spring Carnival," Bowler said.
  "His win last Saturday was outstanding.
  "He just left those seasoned horses stranded when he accelerated at the
400m and he maintained his run right to the post.
  "I think Cavalry will eventually prove himself a very classy horse."
  The other high ranking three-year-olds in Bowler's assessment were Victoria
Derby winner Raveneaux and King Of Brooklyn.
  Cavalry gets the test of his career in the $75,000 Sandown Guineas (1600m)
on Saturday.
  He has risen sharply in distance from 1100m two weeks ago but if he settles
in Saturday's race he's going to take running down.
  But if Cavalry doesn't get speed to allow him to relax, then he could
be tested running out the tough Sandown mile.
  Craig Dinn has been booked for stablemate Western Ace in the Guineas
while Harry White has the Cavalry mount.
  Part-owner Ernie Smith says Western Ace is on trial for the Perth Derby
double and claims his three-year-old will stay the 2400m.
  But the man standing between a Tommy Smith Guineas win on Saturday is
their stable jockey Mick Dittman.
  Dittman is sticking with boom Adelaide three-year-old King Of Brooklyn
who looked definite Derby material when he bolted in at Flemington over
2000m on November 6.
  King Of Brooklyn's problem on Saturday is switching back in distance but
Sandown will help him," Dittman said.
  "But if this horse can improve over the next month he could make a clean
sweep of the two Derbies in Perth.
