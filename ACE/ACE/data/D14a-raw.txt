	<h> The gospel according to Saint Mick </h>
	


	<bl> By Craig Bailey </bl>
	

  Paul Hogan calls his first film a `feel good movie'. He's right. I'm hardly
your average Australian bushman, but the crocodile poacher from Walkabout
Creek aroused my Aussie pride and, while not exactly having me rollicking
in the aisle, gave me quite a few laughs.
  Dundee may not boast the hi-tech stuff of George Lucas. It lacks the violence
of Rambo. Its characters are few and budget meagre next to the average American
film. But it's the most watched movie in Australia, and there's got to be
a good reason for that.
  Despite a sojourn in New York and an American co-star, Dundee is about
as Australian as you can get. As a hero, Mick Dundee leaves Ned Kelly, the
Man from Snowy River and Dame Edna for dead. The little Aussie battler has
grown up. No longer just anti-authority, poor victim of circumstance, purely
cynical, but a battler who takes on the world and wins. `That's why you
have so many accidents over here,' the outback bushman declares to a
thoroughbred New Yorker. `Your steering wheel's on the wrong side of the
car!'
  Hogan trivializes his film when he describes the Oz imagination, the spirit
of Australia. We're too skeptical to be taken in by a flying kangaroo, but
a crocodile poacher, super barramundi fisherman who picks up King Browns
and casually flings them aside is almost believable, and very appealing.


	<h> MATESHIP GOSPEL </h>
	

  What makes our new folk hero so attractive is this: he promotes a gospel
that is palatable, particularly to the male of the species. He is the sum
of how we like to think about ourselves.
  For starters, it is a gospel of mateship, an idea very much alive in
most Australians - the myth that keeps many from utter despair. If you can't
depend on your mates, what hope is there? In a land which by its sheer size
and harshness threatens to swallow us, mateship makes life bearable. A
sobering moment in Dundee's*dundee's gospel is served up in an elaborate
N.Y. party when, after being introduced to a lady who visits a `shrink',
he asks, `Hasn't she got any mates?'
  Mixed with respect for mateship is Dundee's contempt for superiority and
pretence, like table manners at an exclusive restaurant. Those who cross
his lines of acceptability usually become victims of a swift punch in the
mouth. Equally, his genuine concern for the underdog - the Aborigine, the
street girl - characterize*chracterize his `everyone's-me-mate' philosophy:
`Be in town for a couple 'a days. See ya round,' he offers from a taxi cab
window to one of New York's 7 million residents!
  Dundee's gospel is underscored by a kind of morality that is not far from
a believed-in (though not often practised), morality that is basic to the
Australian. It is a close-to-the-earth, survival morality. Its highest
ideal is mateship and it's moulded by the land: land rights? `We belong
to the land, it doesn't belong to us,' says Crocodile Mick. While Rambo
is busy bulldozing his surroundings with guns and knives, and dispensing
justice with iron gloves, Dundee survives rather than conquers, and his
primary weapon is his dry humour.
  It's the wit that characterizes the lighter side of Aussie morality -
it mocks the false and showy, but affectionately points to some great
Australian truth - if nothing else, that life is to be enjoyed despite
adversity.
  Crocodile Dundee says a lot about the things many Australians value. Those
things are not entirely foreign to the Gospel. As John Hannaford points
out, `Jesus likes Aussies...He likes the way we care about the battler and
the underdog...' There are many things about Mick Dundee that I think Jesus
likes. If it's true that he characterizes the Australian experience of life
then could it be that we Christians need to spend less time condemning the
evil around us and recognising the good? Is it possible that in the process
we'd be able to present our Gospel in a more relevant fashion to our Australian
mates without compromising its content? `Me and God, we're mates,' says
Crocodile Dundee. Maybe with a more positive relevant Church, God could
become his Lord and Saviour as well.
