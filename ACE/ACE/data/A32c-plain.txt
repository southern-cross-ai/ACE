RACT is critical of single lane plan  

THE RACT has criticised a plan to build the new Bass highway between Launceston
and Deloraine substantially to singlelane standard.
  The RACT's Launceston manager, Mr Lloyd Redman, said that as the link
between Launceston and the North-West was the busiest stretch of national
highway in Tasmania it should be all dual-lane highway.
  "This is a major route for tourists and heavy vehicles taking sea freight
to Devonport and Burnie," he said.
  "A single-lane highway will not be adequate for present needs, let alone
the future.
  "Why has the DMR (Department of Main Roads) chosen to end the dual-lane
at Hadspen?"  (It will be dual-lane as far as Hadspen, and single-lane from
Hadspen to Deloraine).
  "At the very least there should be overtaking lanes and all bridges built
to dual-lane specifications," Mr Redman said.
  While he welcomed the new highway, he said that the good sight-distances
and straights of the highway would encourage constant overtaking, with the
accompanying risk of high-speed head-on accidents.
  The Westbury Council also welcomed the new highway yesterday and accepted
the DMR's estimation that singlelane standard would be adequate.
  The road - which will take five to seven years to build - will connect
with the Prospect bypass which runs from Launceston's southern outlet to
the western outskirts of the city.
  The new highway will cross the existing Bass highway at Prospect and
run just north of it until the Pateena Rd junction (which leads to Longford).
  The new road crosses back to the southern side of the existing one just
past Pateena Rd, and remains on the southern side until just east of Westbury,
where it crosses back to the northern side.
  Two routes are being considered for the Westbury-Deloraine section: 
one which remains on the northern side of the present road and one which
crosses back over the existing road to bypass Exton to the south.
