Two fighters  

THE recent sad deaths of two men carried a message of inspiration for other
Australians.
  Phil Thompson, the dedicated campaigner for the rights of Australia's
47,000 Vietnam veterans, was a man who put the problems of others above
his own.
  Although in constant pain from wounds he received in action in Vietnam
and involved in an 11-year battle with cancer, he gave everything to the
cause - undertaking a strenuous and constant work load.
  He represented Australian veterans in a successful class-action against
US chemical companies and was a force behind the Senate inquiry and subsequent
Evatt Royal Commission into the effects of chemical herbicides.
  He will be sadly missed by Vietnam veterans, but his example will endure.
  John O'Malley, Australia's first heart and lung transplant recipient,
fought his own battle with quiet and cheerful courage.
  He knew the risks of the pioneering operation he underwent and accepted
them philosophically and with optimism.
  During his long wait for a suitable donor to be found his bravery was
an inspiration not only to his family, friends and the medical team but
also to others who face similar tragic illness.
