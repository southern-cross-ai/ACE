	<h> Inventor seeks foreign backing </h>

THE man judged Australian Inventor of the Year in 1980 says tax imposts are 
forcing him to seek overseas backing for his latest creation: a pocket-sized 
emergency safety beacon which may save the lives of snow skiers, hikers and 
other adventure seekers. 
  The sophisticated device, weighing only 160g, emits a continuous radio 
homing beacon which makes it usable in the most remote country. 
  But according to its inventor, Mr Iain Saul, import taxes of up to 30
per cent on components and a sales tax of 20 per cent make the cost of
producing it in Australia uneconomic. 
  In addition, Mr Saul has encountered difficulties in obtaining a frequency 
allocation for the mini safety beacon which emits a continuous signal for 60 
hours after it is activated. 
  &quot;The Department of Civil Aviation didn't want the beacons transmitting 
because they thought people would set them off in a mischievous manner. 
  &quot;The Department of Communications recognised the need for the beacon, 
took the bull by the horns and allocated a frequency,&quot; said Mr Saul. 
  &quot;They made up their minds about six weeks ago at a meeting where the 
disappearance of Simon Crean's brother in the snow was mentioned,&quot; he said. 
  The beacon is designed for one-off use only, to discourage pranksters. 
  Despite a decision to manufacture the first batch at the small Consolidated 
Technology factory in the Melbourne suburb of Frankston,  the inventor, who 
is also managing director of Consolidated Technology, doubts whether 
manufacturing will prove practicable in Australia. 
  &quot;There are virtually no manufacturers of electronic components any more in 
Australia.  There used to be a lot but they found it cheaper to manufacture 
overseas,&quot; he said.
  Consequently most components for the safety beacon must be imported and the
import tax ranges from 2 per cent to 30 per cent.
