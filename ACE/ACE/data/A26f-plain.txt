A `pensioner's burial' for key Soviet figure MOSCOW, Thursday - 

 One of the key shapers of Soviet history, Vyacheslav
Molotov, was buried at a Moscow cemetery yesterday after a discreet funeral
described by a Foreign Ministry official as "a private burial for a pensioner".
  Mr Molotov, 96, died on Saturday.  An organiser of the 1917 Bolshevik
revolution, he worked at the centre of Kremlin power throughout the Stalin
era but later fell into disgrace and was ejected from the Communist Party.
  Although denied an official funeral, Mr Molotov was buried at the Novodevichy
cemetery, second in prestige only to the Kremlin.  This reflected Mr Molotov's
readmission to the party two years ago.
  One party Central Committee member was present at the burial, attended
by relatives and friends.
  Six busloads of mourners arrived at the cemetery, protected by police
who kept onlookers and journalists away.  One of the buses, its windows draped
in black, drove in through the massive green gates of the cemetery ramparts.
  Cemetery officials said Mr Molotov was to be buried next to his wife, Polina
Zhemchuzhina, who died in 1967 after surviving years in labor camps under
Kremlin dictator Josef Stalin.  Mr Molotov is said to have signed her arrest
warrant.
  The plot lies near the site where Stalin's wife, Nadezhda Alliluyeva,
was buried in 1932 after committing suicide.
  It is a good distance from the grave of Nikita Krushchev, who ousted Mr
Molotov from the party leadership in 1957.
  One elderly man in a crowd of onlookers said he had come to pay his last
respects but had not been allowed inside.  He was clutching a bouquet of
purple chrysanthemums and wore a bronze medal of Stalin.
  "Molotov made a few mistakes.  He was in the anti-party group," declared
the man, who said he worked in the Soviet defence industry and was not a
Communist Party member.
