	<h> The Chinaman's Snake </h>
	

  In the hut, beside a huge vegie garden, lived a young Chinese couple. In
the back of the hut was an old stove, still in use, in which wood was used
for fuel. At this particular time the stove was quite cold as there wasn't
any fire alight.

  Jimmy the Chinaman spotted a brown snake rearing up from behind the stove.
He gave a shriek, told his wife to watch the snake, while he raced up to
the local pub to get help.

  He finally got the message across that there was a snake in the hut. Amidst
the yells, some wit mentioned something about a snake calling in for a Chinese
meal. As Bluey lived between the Pub and Jimmy's place he volunteered to
&quot;Soon fix that snake, Jimmy my boy!&quot; Bluey called at his own house, picked
up his double barrelled shotgun and shortly afterwards entered the hut.

  Bluey had a look about; the Chinese lady kept pointing to the back of the
stove, so finally Bluey understood where the snake was last seen.

  &quot;We'll light a fire in the stove,&quot; quoted Bluey, &quot;That'll fetch the villain
out.&quot;

  Next came a screech from Jimmy, who was standing about 20 yards away from
the front of the hut. &quot;Light a fire, Mrs.&quot;

  So Jimmy's wife lit a fire. Meanwhile, Bluey, who had consumed a few too
many beers, was standing near the stove, with the shotgun hanging slackly
in his arm, peering over the top of the stove.

  The stove warmed up; the snake came out fast. Jimmy's wife screeched and
pointed. Both barrels exploded and blew the old stove to pieces. A great
cloud of ash and dust filled half the room. The snake slithered out the front
door, around the side of the hut and disappeared into long grass.

  Bluey and Jimmy then went back to the local for a `nerve steadier', while
Jimmy's wife was once again left to guard the camp.
