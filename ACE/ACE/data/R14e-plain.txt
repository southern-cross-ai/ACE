Foxy?  

  Donnie told his yarn at The Holbrook Hotel, after travelling through
the bush from Tumbarumba.
  As fox skins were worth about $40 each that winter, Donnie would at most
times have his shotgun in his car, for, "You never know from where a fox
will spring."
  He stopped his car beside a rough, bracken covered gully, got his fox
whistle and shotgun from the car and selected a position where he stood
very still, and blew the whistle. He then realized that he had only one
cartridge in the gun and did not have any more in the car. Of course, if
a fox did trot up, that shouldn't cause any problem.
  However, a few minutes later along came two foxes, but about ten yards
apart. Donnie waited patiently, hoping that the foxes would brush close
together, so that he would have a chance of shooting both. A few seconds
ticked by and the foxes were getting very close to Donnie, but still a
long way apart. According to Donnie there was only one thing left to do;
"I gave them the old `swoosh shot' and I got them both!!"
