What would you do if the Family Law Court forbade you to see your children?
  
  It's almost midnight when Steve, a labourer*laborer, gets on the phone to the
crowd he's read about in the Sunday papers: Fathers Against Discrimination in
Childcare.
  &quot;I can't get in my own house!&quot; he cries. &quot;The bitch reckons I beat her
up ... so I get home and she's got a bit of paper saying I can't come in
my own house ...&quot;
  &quot;Whoa!&quot; pleads FADIC organiser Dean Weily. &quot;Start at the beginning.&quot; He
lights a cigarette, dreading what will follow. Steve groans as though his
search for the &quot;beginning&quot; is causing him physical pain.
  &quot;Look, I just want to know what law says I can't go in my own house! You
tell me what fucking law stops a man ... Jeez, I been making payments on
the bastard for six years! So where's the justice, eh? Where's it say I
can't ...&quot;
  Weily grips his hair (Steve's voice conveys an infectious sense of
desperation). Slowly, carefully, Weily explains that a magistrate or a
judge can make any ruling concerning property that he or she sees fit.
It's known as an ex parte ruling and is intended to protect the applicant
from ...
  &quot;But where's the law!&quot; Steve demands. &quot;Where's it written that a man can
be kicked out of his own fucking house? I've called the cops, my local member,
now you. No-one can show me the bloody law that says it!&quot;
  Dean Weily hangs up half an hour later with a familiar feeling of futility:
Steve has not understood. He will probably spend weeks looking for a law
that doesn't exist. In the end he might go over the edge and take out his
fury on his wife, or his children ... or even on the magistrate who made
the ex parte order.
  Not for the first time, Weily - self-appointed adviser to thousands of
Australian men caught up in the grim complexities of divorce, child custody
and access - sees the enemy face-to-face. It is confusion ... the kind of
confusion that spawns despair. Weily thinks of the innumerable &quot;Steves&quot;
out there, each trapped in the quagmire of his own befuddled anguish. Since
he launched FADIC only a couple of months earlier, the young Brisbane
businessman had listened to hundreds of them. Despite FADIC's avowed purpose
(to change perceptions of men as solitary parents and to focus attention
or perceived flaws in the Family Court system) Weily, 27, can't disguise
early misgivings.
  A few days before, he'd told me: &quot;I just want to find out why so many
apparently rational individuals go into the [Family] Court system and emerge
as lunatics who do desperate things ...&quot; But tonight he wonders: is it possible
to achieve anything amidst so much mental chaos?
  &quot;Help me! Help me! moan the voices on his phone. &quot;I'm going to waste myself!&quot;
the voices scream, or more alarmingly: &quot;Nothing matters now.&quot;
  Each caller has a separate story of tragedy and injustice, against a
background of legal battles of astonishing vindictiveness and torturous
complexity. Who's sane and who's crazy? Who's lying and who isn't? Who's
seeking attention and who's a bona fide psychotic?
 Dean Weily smokes another cigarette, staring from his window at the lights
of the city. &quot;Jesus,&quot; he whispers. &quot;This is a bloody nightmare ...&quot;


	<h> News Report - 19.12.85 </h>
	

... A Cairns man who abducted his daughter from her mother's custody and
made her live as a fugitive for 18 months was jailed for 15 months.
  Mr Justice Simpson in the Brisbane Family Court sentenced Allan Lindsay
Sealey, 38, to 15 months jail from the time of his arrest in Perth on November
27, to be released after 10 months subject to a $1000 bond relating to certain
conditions.
  The conditions obliged Sealy to seek a fresh application for access to
his daughter and restrained him from entering or loitering near his wife's
premises. Sealey pleaded guilty to contempt of an access order following
a &quot;bitterly contested&quot; four-day custody hearing in March last year before
Mr Justice Simpson.
  Mrs Rhonda Sealey, 34, said in Cairns yesterday she feared her husband
would try again to take their daughter Jayde, 7, when he was released from
jail. &quot;He told me he would never give her up,&quot; she said. &quot;But I don't know
whether prison is the right place for him. He needs psychiatric help.&quot;
  
  Alan Sealey is slight and sandy-haired; he stands waiting in the prison
visiting area with a big plastic bag full of newspaper and magazine articles,
sworn affidavits, legal transcripts and letters. He puts the bag between
us on the table and watches me attentively, his eyes red-rimmed and his
skin pallid. 
  I ask if he is ill. Sealey shakes his head.
  &quot;Prison is terrible,&quot; he says softly, almost apologetically. He smiles
and rests a hand on the plastic bag, staring down the long table where men
with tattooed arms sit opposite exhausted-looking women in cheap clothes.
  For 90 minutes we discuss what Sealey did on the run with his daughter
... how they lived for nine months in a religious community in Western Australia
and how, on November 27 last year, the forlorn escapade ended when Jayde
was recognised in a small WA town by an off-duty policeman who'd seen pictures
of her in New Idea and on TV. (&quot;Sweetheart, please tell someone who you are
- maybe your teacher or a policeman. Don't be afraid my darling; Mummy is
waiting for you and I love you with all my heart.&quot; 
	<misc>- Rhonda Sealey, New
Idea, 2.2.85)</misc>
	
  Why did Sealey run? Why did he fail to return Jayde to her mother after
a normal access outing on May 5, 1984? He told me his reason many times,
but because of restrictions imposed by the Family Law Act, I cannot quote
him.
  I can quote a letter written by Sealey and read to the court after he
was sentenced on the contempt charge: &quot;I honestly believed, and still do
believe very strongly, that Jayde is in very real moral danger by her continual
exposure to the letter named one of the child's maternal relatives and the
home environment of my former wife,&quot; he wrote.
  &quot;I am remorseful for having been in contempt, however my mind was in
such a state of mental exhaustion, having the continuing worry of my child's
safety and having been involved in many court battles, that I took steps
that perhaps only I understand as the father of Jayde.&quot;
  In other court reports, Sealey's barrister Leo White says his client's
fight was triggered by claims by Jayde that she had been sexually molested.
Barrister Graeme Page, for Mrs Sealey, told the court the sexual incidents
Allan Sealey complained of had been raised in earlier court hearings and
had been &quot;explained as not in any way sexually abusive or arousing.&quot;
  But Mr Page's next reported assertion - that Sealey had not raised the
&quot;incidents&quot; until interviewed on the radio on the run in October last year
and that he had not attempted to &quot;engage in the legal processes open to
him&quot; - seems to contradict his statement that the incidents had been raised
during earlier court hearings.
  In fact, a sworn affidavit exists in which a close relative of Rhonda
Sealey raises these sexual indidents in support of Allan Sealey's bid for
custody of Jayde. According to transcripts from the Sealeys' custody hearing
- also before Mr Justice Simpson in Brisbane - an attempt by Sealey's barrister
to introduce this affidavit as evidence was rejected by the judge, who
described it as &quot;character assassination.&quot;
  Before &quot;stealing&quot; his daughter and hitting the road in his Kombi van,
the ex-photographer had discussed his concern over the sexual incidents
with the Bishop of Cairns, a Member of Parliament and others. Apparently,
their advice was unanimous: Sealey could not hope to win a criminal case.
  At the prison, Sealey tells me he intended to hide from the world with
Jayde until she was 11 - an age, he believes, when she would be able to
make her own judgements about what would be best for her future.
  &quot;Yesterday,&quot; he says, looking at the big plastic bag, &quot;I got a letter
from Rhonda. She told me Jayde would not be writing to me anymore ... or
seeing me.&quot;
  He looks away.
  &quot;Jayde's welfare was always my main concern ... When I get out, I will
apply for access to visit her. I would not take her away again - that was
a mistake. But because of the conditions of my early release, it'll probably
be at least a year after I get out [in September this year] before I can
even see her.&quot;
  (&quot;I just don't believe the sentence is severe enough. He said on television
he would do it again. How safe is Jayde once he gets out? He could come
up here and take her out again and the whole nightmare would start all over.
If the sentence had been five years, it would have given her time to grow
up. Ten months is nothing.&quot;

  I ask Sealey how much time he spends thinking about his problems.
  &quot;All of it,&quot; he says. He picks up his plastic bag and walks off toward the
cell block ... a small man with red eyes, the subject of just one of about
400 warrants for child abduction sworn out yearly in this country.

  Since it replaced the nasty old Matrimonial Causes Act in 1975, the Family
Law Act has been hailed as a brilliant piece of reformist legislation and
damned as the cause of untold misery, violence and tragedy.
  It's made divorce more &quot;civilised&quot; by doing away with the need for tacky
accusations of adultery and cruelty and the use of private investigators,
but - critics say - it's done nothing to improve the three worst problem
areas: custody, maintenance payments and property division.
  Conciliate, don't litigate - the Family Law catchphrase - has worked to
the extent that 90 percent of Australian divorces are now settled outside
the courtroom ... with the divorce rate now running at about one in three.
Yet, although Family Court rulings on custody squabbles involve only a
tiny percentage of separating couples, the aftermath of those decisions
has sometimes been horrendous.
  In NSW, particularly, there's been a wave of terror directed at the Family
Court system, with five attacks on judges since 1980. These include the
shooting of Mr Justice David Opas in Sydney and the bombing of the home
of Mr Justice Watson in 1984, a tragedy that took the life of the Judge's
wife, Pearl.
  In October 1985 a Perth father, distraught over a Family Court ruling giving
custody of their three children to his wife, drove to an isolated area with
the youngsters and took his and their lives by feeding a hosepipe from
the exhaust to its interior.
  Another West Australian, Terry Douglas, became what single fathers' groups
call a &quot;runner&quot; after a Family Court awarded custody to his ex-wife. Captured
with his abducted kids in Queensland, Douglas was returned to Melbourne
and jailed for 18 months for contempt. Near death after a 52-day hunger
strike, Douglas was released from Pentridge prison - winning the battle
but, so far, not the war: he has had no access to his children since 1980.
  Right across the nation, thousands of disgruntled men (and even a few
women) have banded together under various names - Divorce Law Reform, Men's
Confraternity, Lone Fathers, Families Against Unnecessary Legal Trauma,
etc - to proclaim their outrage against the &quot;system&quot; and to try to change
it.
  Their main grievance, hotly denied by Family Court judges and their backup
network of social workers, counsellors and Legal Aid solicitors, is that
the system favors women ... and that statistics used by the Family Court
(especially the oft-quoted claim that fathers get custody of at least one
child in 41 percent of contested cases) do not accurately portray the
situation.
