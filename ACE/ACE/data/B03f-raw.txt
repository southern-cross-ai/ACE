	<h> DRUGS: THE PENALTY IS DEATH</h>
	

NO-ONE likes the death penalty.  No-one wants to see two young Australian
men hang, side-by-side, in a foreign jail.
  In particular no Australian wishes to see Kevin Barlow and Brian Chambers
go to the gallows on Thursday in the grim Pudu jail in Kuala Lumpur.
  Even though they are convicted drug traffickers and they have exhausted
every legal avenue of appeal available to them under Malaysian law.
  And even though there is an*a appealing logic to the argument that if anyone
is going to be executed for dealing in drugs, it should be the bosses who
organise and finance the trade, and not the traffickers - the employees.
  Barlow and Chambers cannot say they were not warned.
  Had they committed a similar crime in Australia they would have got a
jail sentence - there is no death penalty here.
  But they were caught in possession of 179 grams of heroin in Malaysia
in spite of warnings they could not possibly miss about the inevitable 
consequences.
  Other countries have different penalties to Australia - as the 70 or so
Australians languishing in overseas*overseals jails*jail on drug charges know to their
cost.
  In Malaysia hanging is mandatory for anyone caught with 15 grams of heroin.
  The Federal Government has made its views known to the Malaysian authorities.
It has appealed for clemency and expressed its opposition to the death penalty.
  It can do no more than that.
