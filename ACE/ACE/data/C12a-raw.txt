  IF I had to find one word to describe this exquisite performance it would
be harmony.
  Not harmony in the Western musical sense of chords and the like, but harmony
as a balance of form and feeling, a perfect agreement of action and expression.
Whether in the pure classical style or the Western-influenced modern style,
or even in koto versions of Waltzing Matilda and Click Go The Shears, there
was a refinement in the playing of these enchanting young women which
permitted no wasted effort or histrionics. The art of koto playing appears
to be that of economy, with every action perfectly matched to the production
of the desired sound.
  At first it would seem that there is very little to look at. A group of
young women in kimonos kneel beside their instruments, bow politely to the
audience, and begin to play. But before long you are under their spell. Their
modesty and humility and the lack of display, only add to the pleasure
of the performance. It soon becomes clear that the koto, for all its apparent
simplicity - 13 strings stretched aross a wooden soundboard - is an extremely
subtle instrument. The actual plucking of the string is just the beginning
of the process. The sound is then modified in a surprising variety of ways
by applying pressure to the string to bend the pitch, produce vibrato and
so on.
  After a while, one begins to realise that there is a lot to look at.
There is also a lot to listen to. The music of the ensemble pieces moves
from unison to several distinct parts and back again in ways which are quite
different from European music.
  But it was the traditional style that really intrigued and delighted me.
The gentle flow of the music, its delicate and expressive embellishment
and sometimes piquant harmonies belong to an age far removed from the present
and to a culture very different from our own.
  But its beauty, simplicity and refinement conspire to make a most moving
musical experience.
