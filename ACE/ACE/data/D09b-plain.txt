Love Loaf  

  Tonight, millions of people around the world will sit down to a three-course
meal, in a comfortable dining-room.
  Tonight, hundreds of millions of people will not sit down to a three-course
meal, in a house that is only one room.
  That's why World Vision International Clubs are launching the Love Loaf
appeal - they see the little plastic loaves as a constant and close reminder
of the needs of others, who often seem so far away.
  For those who've never heard of a Love Loaf, it is a small bread-shaped
container, which serves as something of a mini collection-box for World
Vision. Its purpose is much wider than that however - WVI Clubs see the
Love Loaf as an ideal way to build up interest within their home.
  WVI Clubs national co-ordinator, Elaine Harris, has an ultimate goal for
the Love Loaf. She wants to see one in every home in Australia and she is
confident that goal is not impossible. All the WVI Clubs around Australia
will be working actively to promote the Love Loaf and will be distributing
them widely.
  Elaine Harris believes there is an endless list of places suitable for
Love Loaves - not only homes, but offices, churches, shops, banks and petrol
stations.
  "You could put a Love Loaf in your car, for instance, and when you pull
up to buy petrol and have spare change, you could put it in the Love Loaf.
Every little bit adds up", says Elaine.
  A Love Loaf filled with dollar coins adds up to about $200 and that money
could buy several Ethiopian farmers an Agpak kit, made up of tools, seeds
and fertilizer, giving those people a chance to rebuild their lives after
years of famine and drought.
