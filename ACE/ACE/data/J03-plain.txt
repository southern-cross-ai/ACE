Benzotriazoles as energetic materials 1.   INTRODUCTION  

  Polynitrodiphenylamines are sought as new dense energetic materials, and
for structure/property correlations, as part of an explosives synthesis
programme.  Derivatives substituted with not more than three nitro groups
in one aromatic ring are readily prepared by direct nitration and/or coupling
reactions.  However, more highly nitrated compounds are not accessible by
these routes, due to the deactivating effect of nitro substituents and the
lability of nitro groups flanked by two adjacent nitro groups.

  The strategem which has been used to synthesise highly nitrated aromatics
involves mixed acid nitration of a suitable nitroaniline, often prepared
by selective reduction of a polynitroaromatic, cleavage of the nitramine
using sulphuric acid in anisole to produce a polynitroaniline which is finally
oxidised using peroxydisulphuric acid (scheme 1).  Compounds prepared by
this route include hexanitrobenzene (HNE) (1) [1], pentanitrotoluene (PNT)
(2) [2] and decanitrobiphenyl (DNBP) (3) [3].  This method was extended
to the synthesis of other highly nitrated polynitroaromatics, and to
investigate similar reactions using diphenylamines.  However, attempts at
nitration of these diphenylamines led unexpectedly to benzotriazoles.  This
report describes the synthesis of several of these compounds and a preliminary
examination of their explosive properties.

  

                        2.  RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 2.1  Synthesis of Materials  

  2,4,6-Trinitrotoluene (TNT) (4) can be selectively reduced with hydrogen
sulphide in dioxan to give 4-amino-2, 6-dinitrotoluene (5) [4] or by using
iron powder in acetic acid to give 2-amino-4, 6-dinitrotoluene (6) [2].
Hydrogen sulphide reduction of 2,4,6-trinitrodiphenylamine (7), chosen as
a model compound to develop the procedure and prepared conveniently by the
reaction of aniline with picryl chloride [5], failed to yield a recoverable
product but reduction using iron powder in acetic acid [6] gave 2-amino-4,
6-dinitrodiphenylamine (8) in good yield.
  Mixed acid nitration of (8) gave only highly coloured solutions from which
no product could be isolated.  However dissolution of (8) in acetic acid
followed by treatment with 100% nitric acid gave a yellow solid, which was
shown spectroscopically not to possess any amino groups.  The 1H n.m.r.
spectrum in d6-DMSO displayed only two meta coupled doublets, each
one proton, at     9.51 and 9.07 (J ~ 2Hz) and a five proton singlet at
   7.61.  The same material was also obtained on treatment of an acetic
acid solution of (8) with sodium nitrite, and the compound was identified
as 1-phenyl-5, 7- dinitrobenzotriazole (9).

                            

  The formation of (9) by treatment of (8) with sodium nitrite is readily
understood in terms of dehydration of an intermediate nitrosamine (10),
or cyclisation of the diazonium cation (11) followed by deprotonation. 
Formation of (9) by action of nitric acid on (8) might result from reaction
of oxides of nitrogen present in the nitric acid, or by deoxygenation of
the 2-N-oxide (13) formed conceptually by dehydration of the nitramine (12).
It should be noted that while benzotriazole-1-oxides [7] have been described
benzotriazole-2-oxides appear to be unknown.

                   

            


  Treatment of (8) with hot nitric acid gave a 1:2 mixture of (9) and
1-(4'-nitrophenyl)-5, 7-dinitrobenzotriazole (14).  A mixture of the same
products was also obtained on treatment of (8) with nitronium tetraflouroborate
in sulpholane, either at ambient temperature or at 110deg;C.  These latter
conditions are less likely to favour the presence of oxides of nitrogen,
perhaps giving greater support to the intermediacy of such species as (12)
and (13).

                                    

  Dissolution of (9) in 54% nitric acid and heating under reflux failed
to give the expected nitration to (14), and the starting material was reclaimed
in quantitative yield.  This suggests that the formation of (14) on nitration
of (8) resulted from competitive nitration of the phenyl ring in (8) followed
by cyclisation.  However more vigorous reaction conditions led to smooth
and selective nitration of (9) in excellent yield.  Nitration in 70% nitric
acid under reflux gave (14), nitration using 100% nitric acid gave 
1-(2',4'-dinitrophenyl)-5, 7-dinitrobenzotriazole (15), while mixed acid
nitration gave 1-(2',4',6',-trinitrophenyl)-5, 7-dinitrobenzotriazole
(16).  In each case the structure was assigned on the basis of i.r. (no
NH absorption) and 1H n.m.r. spectra (presented in Table 1).  While
different nitrating mechanisms are suggested (by product characterisation)
for 100% HNO3 in AcOH and hot 54% HNO3, investigations as to the
nitrating species present were beyond the scope of this study.

                                   

  Coburn prepared (16) [8] (which he named BTX and proposed as a thermally
stable explosive suitable for use in exploding bridgewire detonators [9])
by mixed acid nitration of the benzotriazole (17).  We obtained the same
product on mixed acid nitration of the amine (18).  Among other compounds,
Coburn also prepared the isomers (22) and (25) from 3,5- and
4,5-dinitro-o-phenylenediamine (19) and (23) respectively [8].  We have
now prepared (22) via the amine (21), and (25) by the action of sodium nitrite 
on an acetic acid suspension of (26).  The structures of (22) and (25) followed
from l.r. and 1H n.m.r. spectra (given in Table 1).

                                                 

 2.2  Assessment of Explosive Performance 2.2.1  Density  

  The densities of the benzotriazoles (9), (14), (15), (16), (17), (22)
and (25) were measured using a gas comparison pychnometer and are presented
in Table 2 together with the values estimated using Stine's procedure [10].
The latter is a simple empirical group additivity method which does not
differentiate between isomers, nor does it take into consideration molecular
shapes and steric interactions.  Thus while the density measured for (9)
is in excellent agreement with the calculated value, the more highly nitrated
marerials (15) and (16) are somewhat less dense than predicted.  These lower
densities presumably result from reduced coplanarity of the phenyl and
benzotriazole ring systems arising from steric interaction between the
proximate nitro substituents at the 2' - and 6' - and 7-positions respectively.
There are no such interactions in (17) and (22) and the observed densities
are very close to the predicted values.  Additionally interaction between
the adjacent nitro groups of (25) force them out of the plane of the
benzotriazole ring, and the density is lower than expected.

  2.2.2  Thermal Properties  

  The benzotriazoles (9), (14), (15), (16), (17) and (25) all melted sharply,
with no sign of decomposition, at temperatures between 150째 and 
260째. The benzotriazole (22) did not melt below 260째.
  
  The thermal analysis results obtained by DSC are shown in Table 3.  Except
in the case of (22), the first event observed was melting, with no sign
of decomposition, with the fusion endotherm in the range 6-10 kcal 
mole-1.  Although the phenyl compound (9) showed no sign of exothermic
reaction, compounds (14), (15) and (16) exhibited an exotherm following
the fusion endotherm.  The magnitude of the exotherm increased, as might
be expected, with the degree of nitration.  These results suggest that while
certainly (16) and probably (15) may be sufficiently energetic to be useful
as explosives, compounds (9) and possibly (14) are unlikely to be satisfactory.
The isomeric (25) also showed a melting endotherm and a large exotherm,
while (22) showed no sign of melting and a slightly smaller exotherm.
Interestingly, 1-picryl benzotriazole (17) showed a much larger exotherm
than either (14) or (15), suggesting that the picryl group contributes more
energy to the molecule than does the dinitrobenzotriazole moiety.   

  The benzotriazoles were also examined using the ERDE temperature of ignition
test, in which 50 mg unconfined samples are heated at 5째C min-1 in
a test tube.  The temperature of ignition is that at which the sample ignites
or (more usually) explodes [11].  While the picryl derivatives (16), (17),
(22) and (25) ignited to explosion during this test, the others simply sublimed
and charred.

   2.2.3  Explosive Properties  

    The velocity of detonation and detonation pressure for each of the
benzotriazoles (Table 4) were estimated using the empirical method of Rothstein
and Peterson [12].  This simple method has the advantage that the detonation
parameters are derived solely from molecular formulae and structures, and
requires no knowledge of physical, chemical or thermochemical properties.
It is consequently unable to distinguish between isomers.

    The impact sensitivity of the benzotriazoles (9), (14), (15) and (16)
was measured using the Rotter Impact Test, which monitors the response of
30 milligrams of explosive placed in a metal cup to the impact of a 5 kg
weight dropped onto it.  A Figure of Insensitiveness (F of I) is obtained
by comparison of the 50% "explosion" height for the material with that for
a standard grade of RDX to which is assigned an F of I of 80 [11].  The
impact sensitivity of (22) was also measured, and although insufficient
of (17) and (25) was available for complete testing, "screening" tests were
carried out on these materials.  Results are presented in Table 4.

    The expected increase in the explosive output of the benzotriazoles
with the degree of nitration is again reflected in the calculated velocity
of detonation and detonation pressure.  The values in Table 4 would once
more suggest that while the picryl derivatives (16), (22) and (25) and probably
the 2,4-dinitrophenyl compound (15) are sufficiently energetic to be useful
explosives the less nitrated (9), and possibly (14) and (17), are not.

    The increase in predicted explosive output with the degree of nitration
is parallelled by an increase in the sensitivity to impact of the
benzotriazoles (9), (14), (15) and (16).  Thus 1-phenyl-5,
7-dinitrobenzotriazole (9) is virtually insensitive to impact, (14) and
(15) are progressively more sensitive, whereas 1-picryl-5,
7-dinitrobenzotriazole (16) shows impact sensitivity typical of intermediate
or primary explosives.  The 4,6-dinitro isomer (22) shows similar sensitivity,
and limited screening tests indicate that the 5,6-dinitro isomer (25) and
1-picrylbenzotriazole (17) do also.  It is apparent that the picryl group
contributes more to impact sensitivity than does nitration in the benzotriazole
ring, and it is probable that the "trigger linkage" [13] for impact initiation
is associated with the picryl group.  The relatively minor variation in
sensitivity between the isomeric compounds (16), (22) and (25) may be accounted
for in terms of steric interaction between the 7-nitro group and the picryl
function in (16) and between the adjacent 5-and 6-nitro groups in (25).

  There is also an increase in the electrostatic sensitivity of the
benzotriazoles (9), (14), (15) and (16) with the degree of nitration, but
none of these compounds would be regarded as particularly sensitive to this
stimulus.
                              
                             3.  CONCLUSION  

   Variously nitrated 1-phenylbenzotriazoles have been examined as potential
energetic materials, with reference to their densities, thermal properties,
sensitiveness characteristics and explosive properties.  Densities and
calculated explosive properties (velocity of detonation and detonation
pressure) increase with the degree of nitration, as does the energy released
on thermal decomposition and sensitiveness to impact.  In the case of the
latter two properties, however, it is also clear that nitration of the phenyl
substituent to produce a picryl derivative has more effect than does nitration
in the benzotriazole ring, and it appears that the picryl group provides
the "trigger linkage" for impact initiation.

                             4.  EXPERIMENTAL  

    Warning!  Many of the polynitro compounds described herein are potentially
powerful and sensitive explosives, and should be handled appropriately.
  
    1H n.m.r. spectra were recorded using a Varian EM360L nmr spectrometer
on solutions in d6-dimethylsulphoxide containing tetramethylsilane
as internal standard; data for most compounds is listed in Table 1.  Infrared
spectra were obtained using a Perkin Elmer 683 spectrophotometer using
potassium bromide discs.  Melting points were measured using a Reichert
Heizbank hot strip and are corrected.

    Densities were measured using a gas comparison pychometer (Systems Science
and Software Type G 102-28).  Each compound was subjected to thermal analysis
using a Perkin Elmer DSC-2 Differential Scanning Calorimeter fitted with
a Scanning Auto-Zero accessory and a Thermal Analysis Data Station.  All
samples (0.40 - 1.00 mg) were weighed accurately on a Mettler ME30 analytical
balance directly into aluminium sample pans, and lids were placed (not crimped)
over the samples.  The sample and reference compartments of the calorimeter
were purged continuously with nitrogen gas at 20-25 mL min-1 throughout
the DSC scans, which were carried out at a heating rate of 20 K min-1
over a temperature range 330 - 800 K.  The output was calibrated using samples
of indium (m.p. 429.8 K), tin (m.p. 505.1 K), lead (m.p. 600.7 K) and zinc
(m.p. 692.7 K). 

2,4,6-Trinitrodiphenylamine (7).

This compound was prepared as an orange solid (72%) m.p. 180째 (lit. m.p. 179-80째) by the method of Davis and Ashdown [5].
