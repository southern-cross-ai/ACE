FRAZIER BEATING TIPPED FOR JOE By PETER KOGOY  

LEON Tabbs was in Smokin' Joe Frazier's corner the night Joe Bugner went
the distance with the world heavyweight champ.
  Tabbs was also there when a new generation Frazier, Marvis, pummelled
Bugner into submission over 10 rounds three years ago.
  He'll also be in the opposite corner at the Sydney Entertainment Centre
on Friday night when David Bey, Tabbs' latest protege, fights Bugner in
his second comeback fight.
  Tabbs handled the affairs of such ring luminaries as Benny Briscoe, Boogaloo
Watts, Marvin Johnson and Jerry "The Bull" Martin.
 "They all fought out of the 23rd Police Athletic Gym in 
Philadelphia," says the well-credentialled trainer.
  "David Bey's style is very similar to Smokin' Joe's kid, Marvis," Tabbs
said.
  "Bey throws a strong right bomb and possesses a vicious left hook, so
quick that Bugner won't know where it'll come from," he added.
  Tabbs, not noted for making predictions, tipped Bugner's latest comeback
to be short-lived.
  "My boy is world class, sharp and a real hustler in the ring.
  "There's no way we've come this far to lose."
