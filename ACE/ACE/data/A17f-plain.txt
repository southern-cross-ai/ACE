Wran to head CSIRO SYDNEY  

 - Former NSW Premier Mr Neville Wran will head Australia's largest
scientific organisation, the CSIRO.
  And the news has stunned the science community.  Reactions at the weekend
ranged from dismay to delight.
  Federal Cabinet has broken a 60-year tradition to approve the appointment
of a non-scientist to the post.
  Mr Wran is understood not to have been the first choice for the post, but
no other contender could find the time. 
  Among the candidates were the doyen of Australian science, Sir Gustav Nossal,
and from the business world, Sir Roderick Carnegie.  But both these men
will be on the new CSIRO board.
  Under new CSIRO legislation which passed through Parliament on Friday,
Mr Wran will hold a part-time position.
  The present chairman, Dr Keith Boardman, is expected to be appointed
full-time chief executive by the new board, which includes a mix of scientific
and business acumen.
  Mr Wran and the rest of his revamped board will take up their posts from
January 1.
  The other new board members are Mr Bill Mansfield, an assistant secretary
of the ACTU; Mr David Hoare, the chairman of Bankers Trust Australia, and
Mr Tony Gregson, a businessman and farmer from Victoria's Western District.
  The surviving members from the old board are Professor Adrienne Clarke,
Mr Graham Spurling and Dr Kevin Foley.
