THE SUN SAYS ...
CLEAN OUT THE RORTS 

THE State Government wants to abolish some wasteful work practices among
its public servants.

  Now, in the spirit of efficiency and sweet reason, department and union
representatives are to talk things over. 
  The Premier should make clear that he expects real savings to the public
purse, not a shuffling of the same old pack of industrial tricks.
  Only three months ago, the State Public Accounts Committee noted that
prison officers were blatantly abusing sick leave rights to generate increased
overtime.
  Then, after three years of talks, prison officers agreed to give up certain
practices, including some overtime, in the interests of greater efficiency.
  But there was a pay-off. They work fewer hours and received a lump sum
payment for a delay in introducing the new scheme. Also, the Government
had to hire more staff to make the system work.

  That kind of cosy deal appears to change very little, except to draw more
wool over the public's eyes.

  The Accounts Committee will need to check next year how prison officers
are using sick leave and, if necessary, get stuck into any woolly "efficiency"
deals which remain.
