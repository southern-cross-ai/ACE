 By Mark Thompson  ILLEGAL CASINOS FACE BAD STREAK  

  The NSW Government faces its greatest test of strength with the opening
of its new casino.
  Yet again the government has proposed the introduction of "tough legislation"
to combat the 200 illegal casinos in Sydney.
  It is a statement which has hit the headlines regularly for the past five
years. But this time they mean business.
  For a start the NSW Government would not stand for the competition which
would syphon valuable revenue from their own 100 per cent government-owned
casino.
  With more than $140 million at stake there can be no doubt the government
will ensure that every single illegal casino has been closed.
  The $750 million casino and hotel complex will stand majestically in the
Darling Harbour, which until recently was a neglected piece of real estate
just outside the business district.
  Construction will be completed for the Bicentenary in 1988 but the hotel
complex will not be finished until 1990.

400 tables

  It has been described as Australia's biggest casino and, when compared
with our own achievement just over the Causeway, you can see why.
  The Sydney casino will boast 400 gaming tables and 1500 video slot machines
with a capacity for 11,000 people at one time.
  The Perth casino has room for 4500 patrons, with 142 tables and 300 video
slot machines.                   
  The Sydney casino will have a 28-storey hotel with 700 rooms of five-star
standard.
  The Perth casino and hotel complex, which will cost $280 million, will
have a 12-storey hotel with 412 rooms.
  It is obvious the NSW Government is already getting itchy over the revenue
generated from the casino. 
  Plans are under way to set up an interim casino which will be operating
within six months.
  The problem is that both the government and the developers are still "tossing
up" between several possible sites.
