Music Update Gold gets manager job at Big Time  

ROGER Gold has been appointed general manager of Big Time Records following
the resignation of Brook Massey from the position late last month.
  Gold was Big Time's A&R manager and national promotions manager for three
years.
  According to Gold, Massey resigned because he was "frustrated with the
job and tired of the record industry." He said Massey's departure was
"amicable, to an extent".
  Geoffrey Weiss from Big Time's Boston office will fill Gold's previous
position from April. Weiss headed the Boston office and managed East Coast
Promotions for the past year.
  Big Time's American-based managing director, Fred Bestall, will be in
Sydney later this month to hold talks with Gold and renegotiate Big Time's
distribution deal with EMI Records in Australia.
  Big Time Record's Australian artists include Hoodoo Gurus, Hoxton Creepers
and Painters & Dockers.

 Hot leaves EMI for Lassie film.  

INDEPENDENT Sydney label Hot Records has left distributors EMI and signed
to the Tasmanian distributor Another Record Distribution (ARD).
  Hot Records, which originally distributed its own product, has not been
satisfied with distribution deals previously held with CBS and then EMI.
  Stefan Markovitch set up ARD in Tasmania five years ago. The company
specialises in importing jazz, classical, folk and independent rock music
which isn't covered by the major record companies.
  Hot Records managing director, Martin Jennings, signed with ARD because
the company was independent and had a good performance and financial record.
  ARD has sales representatives in each State. This is the company's first
distribution deal with an Australian label.

 Moyle sets up Black Flag label  

FORMER product manager of Regular Records John Moyle has started his own
label - Black Flag Records.

earlier this year, will not be replaced immediately. Fabinyi and general
manager, Jennifer Wright, will reassess the structure of the company given
an expected increase in business this year.
  Regular will release three albums over the next two months - from I'm
Talking, Scribble and Icehouse.

 Rolling Stone's music awards  

ROLLING Stone Australia magazine and Sydney radio station 2MMM will stage
the first "Australian Music Awards" this year.

be held in Sydney in April.
  The awards will be divided into two categories: industry votes for several
classes of achievement and a public vote for act of the year.

will fill the gap left by other awards. The Rolling Stone awards are
exclusively for Australian rock artists.
  The awards will be broadcast on 2MMM in Sydney and EON-FM in Melbourne.
