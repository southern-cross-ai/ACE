Parson trial stalls LONDON (AAP):  

  A worldwide hunt for a missing witness brought an abrupt
halt to the trial of a self-styled international evangelist accused of drugging
and raping devout young Christian virgins in his flock.
  Discharging an Old Bailey jury of nine men and three women who have spent
the last two weeks hearing the alleged victims give evidence against the
57-year old South African-born preacher, Judge Nina Lowry said: "It's no-one's
fault."
  She explained that despite "intensive inquiries" a witness wanted by the
defence had not been found.  But there were hopes she could be located within
the next few weeks.
  She told the jury: "I can't keep you waiting here for a few weeks.  The
defence have applied for more time for justice to be done, they shall have
that opportunity."
  "Time and money have been spent which is regrettable, and will have to
be again.  It's no-one's fault, but I can't risk the defence being
disadvantaged.  I reluctantly have to discharge you from giving verdicts
in this case."
  The aborted trial is thought to have cost more than $115,400 including
the expenses of two witnesses flown from Australia.  A new trial is expected
to start in January.
  Prosecution have alleged that while on an evangelical crusade in Queensland,
the preacher drugged a 14-year old schoolgirl and, while pretending to
pray at her bedside, put his hands under the blankets and indecently assaulted
her.  Also that he raped her at her outback home while her parents slept.
