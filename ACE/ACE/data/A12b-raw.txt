	<h> French doubts on Syria </h>
	


	<misc> PARIS, Thursday (AFP). -</misc>
	

France is convinced of the culpability of a Lebanese family in a wave of
Paris terror bombings last month which killed 10 people, but it remains
sceptical of any Syrian involvement, the French Minister for Interior, Mr
Charles Pasqua, said today in Paris.
  In a radio interview, Mr Pasqua said police were &quot;entirely convinced of
the culpability of the Abdallah clan&quot;, brothers of Georges Ibrahim Abdallah,
the jailed presumed leader of the Lebanese Armed Revolutionary factions,
in attacks in Paris in September which left 10 dead and 162 wounded.
  Mr Pasqua said the French Government had no proof of Syrian involvement
in the Paris bombs, although this was not to give Syria a totally &quot;clean
bill of health&quot;.
  He stressed that the conservative Government refused &quot;to negotiate with
terrorists&quot; and was committed to bringing them to justice.
  But he refused to comment on an article in yesterday's Le Monde claiming
that the Government had used Syrian and Algerian intermediaries to arrange
a four-month truce with the Abdallah clan on the understanding that a
scheduled February court hearing against Georges Abdallah could go in his
favour.
  The Minister's remarks came four days after France, along with other European
Economic Community countries, failed to endorse a British call at an EEC
foreign minister's meeting for tough diplomatic and other sanctions against
Syria.
  Yesterday, however, France announced it had frozen arms sales to Syria,
in response to the British call for measures against that country.
