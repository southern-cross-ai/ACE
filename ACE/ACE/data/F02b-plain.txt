TV Hopefuls Stalled in PNG By Judith Hoare A$10 million station lies idle as Packer hovers  

  The anti-television Third World Prime minister saw no harm in giving a
few minutes of his time to two representatives of the local video company. But
when two white strangers entered his office with them the prime minister's
warning signals began to flash. He did not know who they were, and all four
had signed an appointment book under the one card. After 15 minutes the
irritated PM asked everyone to leave, but not before the stangers had been
asked to identify themselves. It turned out they were executives of an
Australian TV network lobbying for permission to introduce the upbeat bonanza
of its entertainment medium.
  The senior of the two was Lynton Taylor, executive vice-president of Kerry
Packer's Publishing and Broadcasting Ltd, operator of the Channel Nine Network
and the man who did most to bring the World Series Cricket "circus" into
being. The country where he was lobbying, in February this year, was Papua
New Guinea; the angry prime minister was Paias Wingti. Packer's PBL - which
now owns 50% of Media Niugini, the company whose local executives Wingti
had agreed to see - soon afterwards received a letter of protest against
the tactics used to beat a path to the prime minister's door. Such is TV
politics PNG-style. It has left a rival company controlled by Perth Millionaire
Kevin Parry high and dry with a $A10-million new TV station and a complete
ban on broadcasting.
  PBL already has the right to establish broadcast TV in Fiji. PNG is its
next frontier. But once again it faces opposition from Parry's Newcastle-based
NBN Ltd, whose PNG arm is the 87%-owned Niugini Television Network (NTN).
  Knocking over the Parry Corporation in PNG presents Packer with a much
tougher proposition. In fact, if there had not been a change of government
in PNG, chances are Parry's subsidiary would have been beaming TV around
the mountainous nation already. When Wingti ousted his former chief, Prime
Minister Michael Somare last November, NTN had already won approval from
the PNG government to be the first entrant to the nation's untapped broadcast
TV market.
