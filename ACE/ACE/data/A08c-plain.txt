42 INJURED ON FUN PARK RIDE  

FORTY-two people were injured when a roller coaster train crashed into
the rear of another which had stopped too soon at an amusement park in western
Japan.
  Two people were injured seriously while the others suffered mild shock
and nosebleeds after bumping into the seats in front of them, said Hirokichi
Ueda, an official at the Nagashima Spaland amusement park, 300kms west of
Tokyo.
  Ueda said one 28-seat train was just finishing its run yesterday when
it crashed into another which had accidentally stopped 13m short of the boarding
station.                                                               
  The incoming train was travelling at 5-6km/h and both trains were filled
to capacity, he said.
