	<h> Parents can teach too </h>
	

Dear Sir

  Pearl Wickenden complains that the Government is failing to educate children
about the dangers of AIDS.
  I am sick to death of reading such letters. Why is it always the Government
which has to take on all the teaching of our children? Teach your children
yourself, instead of taking the easy way out.

	<h> SMOKE MENACE </h>
	

  In asserting that by smoking he harms only himself P.U.J.Parsons, betrays
a lack of knowledge about the scientific findings of passive smoking.
  Smokers should be aware that the smoke drifting from their cigarettes
contains greater concentrations of cancer-causing chemicals than the smoke
they inhale. Fortunately, this sidestream  smoke is diluted appreciably
with air before it reaches bystanders' lungs.
  However, they do not have the protection of cigarette filters, which prevent
a good deal of this pollution from entering smokers' lungs, yet cannot save
many from developing smoking-related diseases.

	<h> ANIMAL? NO, HUMAN! </h>
	

  I must protest at your use of the word &quot;animal&quot; on your front page  headline
(24.9.86) to describe the killer of two Beenleigh women. How dare you insult
animals in this way. You should have used the word &quot;human&quot;.
