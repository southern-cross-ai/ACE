Vamp Grace plays for laughs -Vamp (M)
Academy and Glenelg Cinema City from tomorrow. Preview by Megan Campbell.  

  In her latest film, earthy-voiced singer Grace Jones plays out part of her
real-life career.
  The raunchy "wild woman of rock" has been cast as a band leader in Vamp,
which opens in Adelaide tomorrow.
  But the slinky Grace is not all she appears to be.
  In Vamp - a "horror comedy of sex and the supernatural" - she is not only
Katrina the band leader but (as the title suggests) a vampire and a stripper
too!
  Working from the murky depths of the After Dark Club, Katrina and a bevy
of bloodsuckers treat their nocturnal visitors to some amazing performances.
  One night a trio of ignorant college students (played by Chris Makepeace,
Gedde Wattanabe and Robert Rusler) descend on the After Dark Club in search
of a stripper to entertain at a fraternity party.
