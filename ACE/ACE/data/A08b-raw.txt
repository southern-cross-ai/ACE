	<h>`POPESCOPE' A BIG BUSINESS </h>
	

FIRST came the Pope Mobile, then Pope T-shirts - and now it's the &quot;Popescope&quot;.
  An Adelaide man has just won church approval for a cardboard and glass
periscope to enable short people in crowds to see the Pope during his visit
to Australia.
  The national papal tour office yesterday gave schoolteacher Paul Doherty
a licence for his &quot;Popescope&quot;.
  He hopes to sell 10,000 &quot;Popescopes&quot; at $5 each during the papal visit.
