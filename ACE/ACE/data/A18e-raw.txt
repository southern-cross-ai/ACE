DIRECTORS of The Herald and Weekly Times said The Sun showed there was a
strong future for newspapers.
  &quot;We strongly believe in the future of newspapers, and plans are in place
for future expansion,&quot; they said.
  &quot;The best example of the continuing future of newspapers is The Sun.
  &quot;By any criteria it is an amazing success story.  An average daily
circulation in excess of 550,000 makes it an institution in Melbourne and
country towns throughout Victoria.&quot;
  Directors said The Sun was sold by 7500 newsagents and sub-agents
and home-delivered before most people rose.
  They said all afternoon newspapers were facing the difficult task of finding
answers to falling circulation.
  &quot;Our policy is to establish The Herald as Melbourne's newspaper and this
year under the theme `Your Town - Your Paper' new sections and features
have been added,&quot; they said.
  &quot;The Herald remains one of Australia's largest selling afternoon
newspapers, and compares favorably in circulation with most morning
newspapers.&quot;  
   Directors said that in regional areas the HWT was well represented, 
with The Weekly Times continuing to sell more than 100,000
copies a week.
  The Geelong Advertiser, The Geelong News and The Bellarine Echo all made
a major contribution to group profits, while the Bendigo Advertiser produced
a record profit, despite the depressed rural economy.
  With the acquisition of the Leader group, the HWT also became the largest
suburban newspaper publisher in Victoria.
