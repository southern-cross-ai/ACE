Hunter role for an Aussie star  

  Australian actor Vernon Wells of Mad Max fame makes a guest
appearance in the popular Hunter series on Tuesday night.
  Hunter has been one of the success stories of the year for Channel Seven
in its 8.30pm timeslot and fans won't be disappointed 
by this week's episode.
  Hunter (Fred Dryer) and his trusty offsider Dee Dee McCall 
(Stepfanie Kramer) set off on the trail of a prostitute's killer.

   Sixties  

  The killer is named Zajak (Wells), and before the next 60 minutes is over
the trio have smashed, bashed and crashed their way through half of Los
Angeles.
  There is a cross plot with drugs and mercenaries, but that is not really
the point in Hunter.
  There is another good reason to watch Hunter tonight - the music.
  When Dee Dee goes undercover in a couple of bars, the background music
is original sixties with greats by The Rolling Stones, The Kinks, and Cream.
  It's enough to make a sixties boy go all misty-eyed - or maybe it was
just the sight of Dee Dee in that little mini skirt.
  Channel 7's other top-class crime show, Bergerac, is back for a fourth
series in the 9.45pm timeslot on Saturday.
  It's a fine British production based around a detective sergeant in Bureau
de Etrangers on Jersey.
  The bureau deals with crimes relating to island visitors and there is
always plenty of action for Det Sgt Jim Bergerac (John Nettles).
  In this week's episode Bergerac is assigned as the official
guide-cum-bodyguard to a visiting British MP.
  A hired killer comes to the island to stop the MP signing an important
trade agreement.
  Bergerac also has a new romantic interest played by Louise Jameson.
