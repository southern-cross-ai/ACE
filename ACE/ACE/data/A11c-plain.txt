The gamble that set a punter up for life IAN MANNING MELBOURNE:  

Les Theodore was fortunate to have been born a gambler, the type
of do-or-die gambler who backs an opinion to the hilt.
  Theodore, 37, is making a big name for himself these days as the trainer
of the outstanding three-year-old Campaign King, but the road to success
from the NSW border town of Berrigan has not always been smooth.
  In fact, if Theodore had not been prepared to gamble he would probably
have been at home in Berrigan yesterday instead of being in Melbourne to
win Saturday's $151,000 Newmarket Handicap with Campaign King.
  "I'm a punter," he said, resting on the bar at his Melbourne motel. 
  "I've been betting since I was 15 - the dogs, the trots, the horses,
anything.  It was something that came naturally at an early age.  And, given
the chance, I wouldn't change a thing."
  Not surprisingly.  One of Theodore's biggest gambles was the purchase
of Campaign King for $12,000 as a two-year-old.
  The tough-as-teak colt has now won 11 of his 15 starts for more than $200,000
in prize money.
  Even the most fearless of punters would applaud Theodore's courage in
purchasing Campaign King.  He outlaid just about everything on a young colt
with only a maiden win at Berrigan under his girth.  
  "I had leased Campaign King from a bloke in Melbourne and would have been
happy to keep it that way," he said.  "But after his first win I knew he
was going to be something special.
  "I rang the owner and said I wanted to buy the colt and he said I could
have him for $15,000, which I thought was a bit steep considering the horse
had won at Berrigan, not Flemington.
