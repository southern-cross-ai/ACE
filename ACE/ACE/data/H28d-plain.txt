FLOAT ON PEACE  

     The Nepean VAD cadets, winners of the Red Cross Lady
Cutler Cup, entered a float on the theme of International Year
of Peace in the Australia Day procession through Penrith and
St Marys on Monday, January 27.

     The group has been entering a float in the procession for
the past eight years, and received a plaque for the best
decorated float last year. This year's float was decorated with
blue, red and white streamers coming down from a maypole and
circling the truck. A large dove, and peace symbols were also
part of the display, as well as maps of Australia. Director of
the Voluntary Aid Service Corps, Miss Phyl Jenkins, said the
cadet leaders, Mrs Jean Stephens, and Mrs Lorna Parr, and the
cadets put many hours of hard work into the float.

     "Although they didn't win anything this year, they are to
be commended for their community mindedness, and their hard
work," she said.
