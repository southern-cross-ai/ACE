Hotels hit hard by beer strike  

THE beer crisis worsened at the weekend as supplies dwindled in hotels
and retail outlets.
  The state president of the Australian Hotels' Association, Mr Daryl
Washington, said yesterday the situation with draught beer was "critical".
  "Many hotels are out of draught beer and packaged beer supplies are very
low," he said.
  "All hotels are in real trouble."
  "Even if the men went back to work tomorrow, it could take one to two weeks
before supplies got back to normal," Mr Washington said.
  "The strike is costing the community millions of dollars in Federal and
State Government tax and licence fees, all of which will have to be borne
by the public."
  Mr Washington said the viability of bottle shops and retailers was also
threatened by the strike.
  "The Federal and State Governments should get involved immediately and
make sure the union and the brewery get together to resolve the situation,"
he said.
  The brewery workers are striking for an extra week's Christmas bonus.
  A CUB spokesman said no talks were held with the union at the weekend.
  The company was waiting on the response of the strikers on a letter urging
them to return to work, he said.
  A spokesman for the Federated Liquor and Allied Industries' Union was
unavailable for comment.
