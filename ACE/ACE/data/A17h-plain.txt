Liberal HQ is hit by vandals SYDNEY  

- Vandals have hit Liberal Party property for the third time.
  MPs have moved into Heathcote, south of Sydney, for the by-election to
replace the former sitting member, Mr Rex Jackson.
  The Opposition Leader, Mr Greiner, said yesterday the three attacks on
Liberal Party offices and a promotional balloon at Heathcote, were due
to insufficient policing.
  In the latest incident this weekend, damage worth $1000 was caused when
bricks were thrown through plate-glass windows.
  Heathcote faces a by-election in January after the resignation of Mr Jackson,
a former corrective services minister.
