Pilot `may have been asleep' SYDNEY:  

  A pilot on a flight from Sydney to Brisbane may have fallen asleep
behind the controls, aviation authorities believe.
  The Bureau of Air Safety Investigation has begun an inquiry into the mid-air
incident.
  The pilot was commanding a freight operations flight to Brisbane on
Monday morning but shortly before touching down failed to report his position
to airport control.
  "We don't really know what happened up there," a spokesman, Mr John Death,
said today.
  "We are fully aware of the incident and have begun a thorough investigation.
  "For some reason the pilot failed to report his position but there was
no actual danger involved."
  The pilot, who landed the plane without incident, has been grounded while
the investigation is carried out.
  Airline authorities believe he may have experienced a technical breakdown,
but have not ruled out the possibility he could have fallen asleep at the
controls.
