JAN STEPHENSON looked stylish enough in bright slacks and top as she breezed
around Lake Karrinyup golf course.
  One might even have conceded she's reasonably well-preserved for 35 and
not unattractive.
  But out on the fairways and around the greens, Jan neither looks or acts
like the reputed sex kitten of international women's sport.
  This week, it's been the length of her birdie putts, not her skirt, that
has had male members of the gallery ogling.
  And when called to the microphone to accept a gold medallion she won after
teaming with Greg Norman in an international challenge match, she gushed
cliches with the innocence of a girl-next-door.
  Yet only last weekend, Dunlop Slazenger released Jan's 1987 golf calendar
pictures to Sunday papers across the country to coincide with her arrival.
  Jan flew into Sydney prepared for a feminist furore over the seven
provocative poses but said:  &quot;While the guys want to see me, I guess I'll
continue to take off my clothes for the camera.&quot;
  Last year she was in a poster impersonating Marilyn Monroe with the caption:
&quot;Play a round with me.&quot;
  The picture originally appeared in an LPGA magazine and caused a storm
among fellow professionals.
  Former US Open champion Jane Blalock has been one of Jan's sternest critics.
  &quot;I am totally opposed to what I call quasi-pornography being used to market
our tour,&quot; Blalock said on a prime-time national TV interview in the US.
  &quot;Is our organisation so desperate, so unaware of the real glamor and
attraction staring it in the face, that it must resort to such trash?&quot;
  Through the criticism, Jan, said to have a standing offer of $150,000
to pose for Penthouse, remains unmoved.
  The Balmain girl has learned to live with controversy since she was
reprimanded by starchy Australian Ladies' Golf Union officials for wearing
psychedelic panties under a mini-skirt when she was a teenager.
  Since she turned professional, Jan's personal life has resembled a TV
&quot;soapie.&quot;
  Yet through numerous personal crises she has played superb golf - winning
a US Open, US PGA and becoming the first woman to break 200 for a 54-hole
tournament.
  Four years ago a London newspaper asked:  &quot;Is Jan Stephenson a femme fatale,
who drives men out of their minds with her sexual magneticism?
  &quot;Or is Jan Stephenson, for all her education, looks and talent, a weak
and embarrassingly insecure female, clearly influenced and manipulated
by men for their own power and financial gain?&quot;
  At the time she was the central figure in a bizarre tug-of-war between
Eddie Vossler and Larry Kolb, who each claimed to be her husband.
  When Jan sought to have her two-month marriage to Kolb, then her manager,
annulled he tried unsuccessfully to have her committed to a mental hospital.
  Kolb then gained a court order to freeze her assets, claiming Vossler
had manipulated her. 
  Kolb claimed Jan had become a &quot;tiny caged bird&quot;.
  Eventually a judge ruled Jan could not be married to Kolb because under
Texas law, she was already Vossler's common law wife.  Jan's life story,
Open Season, is said to be &quot;in the pipeline&quot;.
  Her choice to play the lead in the film version of the book is Cheryl
Ladd.
  It should be a box office hit but its*it's completion is not one of Jan's
major goals at the moment.  She's obsessed with improving her golf game.
  A  fitness and health fanatic, Jan does aerobic exercises and swallows
fists full of vitamin pills daily.
  &quot;I want to be the most famous female athlete in the world,&quot; she said.
