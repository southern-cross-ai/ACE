The Sticky Beak  

Up at the big house, private board had turned out to be something less than
private for Kate.  Mrs. Steel's hearty meals around the kitchen table could
turn into inquisitions. She was the best cook in the district, but Mum Two
would certainly have labelled her a "sticky beak".  The kindest of women,
she had a reckless tongue.  She just had to know, and she just had to tell.
Her family was a captive audience at mealtimes.  Now she had Kate as well.

"What do you think of the head teacher?" and
"Did he tell you about Jason's glass eye?"
