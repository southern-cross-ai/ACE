	<h> Corruption issue </h>
	

Corruption will become a major issue in the State election campaign, State
Liberal Party president John Moore said yesterday.
  &quot;It appears to have become the norm, rather than the exception,&quot; he said.
&quot;The smell will not go away.&quot;
  Mr Moore, who was speaking at the launching of Liberal candidate Denver
Beanland's campaign in Toowong, said he had never seen such a sustained
period of allegations concerning corruption.
  He said a major problem was that Parliament was not permitted to probe
such allegations.
 &quot;Say something against them and you will cop a writ, even though what you
say may well be harmless or totally true,&quot; he said.
  &quot;People who join the National Party expect to have super-citizen rights.&quot;
