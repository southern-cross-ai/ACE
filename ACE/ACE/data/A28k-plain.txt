Piggott pays to prevent charges LONDON:  

  Former champion jockey Lester Piggott will pay the Customs and
Excise Department a six-figure sum to prevent possible criminal charges,
according to a London newspaper.
  The Daily Express said Piggott, who retired from race riding last year,
would pay as much as $977,480 in value added tax in a deal arranged as a
result of an 18-month investigation.
  And the man renowned as the meanest - as well as the greatest - jockey
of his time could face another mammoth Government bill.
