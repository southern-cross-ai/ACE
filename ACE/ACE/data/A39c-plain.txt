$7000 bill to run envoy's mansion  

Household expenses for Australia's roving Ambassador for Disarmament, Richard
Butler, are costing taxpayers about $7000 a week.
  Information tabled in Federal Parliament this week showed the 1985-86
rental for his ambassador's residence in Switzerland was $172,255 - $3312
a week.
  But its current rent is believed to be $258,000 a year - almost $5000
a week.
  Mr Butler's home was recently described in a TV report as a `small mansion
with views over Lake Geneva'.
  The cost of Mr Butler's servants was given as more than $1800 a week.
  Details of Mr Butler's expenses had been sought by Opposition MPs.
  The amount of rent was specifically sought by a Liberal backbencher
Alexander Downer - himself a former diplomat.
  Wages and costs of Mr Butler's domestic servants were $91,732 in 1985-86.
  This figure would also have increased sharply with the devaluation of the
dollar.
  The Opposition's questioning of Mr Butler's expenses has a political
edge to it as he is a former senior private secretary to former Labor Prime
Minister Gough Whitlam.
  He is unlikely to be reappointed under a coalition Government.
  But the Opposition's revised foreign affairs policy will retain Mr Butler's
position of Disarmament Ambassador.
  The yet-to-be-released policy overturns previous criticism of the post
- set up by the present Foreign Minister Bill Hayden.
  Mr Butler is not the only diplomat to attract attention.
  Australia's ambassador to the European Economic Community, Lindsay Duthie,
has raised MPs' eyebrows with his expenses.
  His residence in London is understood to rent for $270,000 a year - around
$5192 a week.
