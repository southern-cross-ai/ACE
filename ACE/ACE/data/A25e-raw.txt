	<h> CROC VICTIM GENTLE MAN - MOTHER </h>
	


	<bl> By Neil Doorley </bl>
	

  The mother of a Queensland man, who was taken by a crocodile in the Gulf
of Carpentaria, said today:  &quot;No one deserves to die like that.
  &quot;What happened to my son was dreadful.  He was such a gentle, caring person.&quot;
  Mrs Elaine Whereat, 68, of Bundaberg, yesterday identified the man taken
by a 4.5m crocodile as he slept on a river bank at Rocky Creek Landing,
Borrooloola, about 700km south-east of Darwin, on September 7, as her son,
Edward Jeffrey Whereat, 39.
  Darwin police had been trying to contact relatives, and released photographs
of Mr Whereat to newspapers &quot;as a last resort&quot;.
  Mr Whereat, whose remains were found in the crocodile two days after he
disappeared, travelled under four different names, but commonly was known
as Lee McLeod.
  His legs were found 100m from where he was attacked.
  Mrs Whereat, a pensioner, said her son's remains probably would be buried
in the Northern Territory this week.  She and her son and daughter could
not afford to attend the funeral.
  &quot;I hadn't seen Edward for 14 years when I found this had happened,&quot; Mrs
Whereat said.  She recognised a photograph of her son in a morning newspaper.
