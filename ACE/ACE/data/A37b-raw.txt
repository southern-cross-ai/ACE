NSW Cricket Association president Alan Davidson, who played in 44 Tests
between 1953 and 1963, said there have been only two standout captains in
his time - Lindsay Hassett and Richie Benaud.
  &quot;I think Richie was the best mainly because our careers went side by side
from schoolboy days,&quot; he said.
  &quot;I understood him and he understood me.  It was always very easy to play
with him.&quot;
  Davidson gives Hassett the credit for moulding him as a player during his
first tour of England in 1953.
  &quot;I will always have a very vivid recollection of Lindsay during that tour,&quot;
he said.  &quot;He had a wonderful understanding of a young player.
  &quot;He was only a little man - but he was very big on understanding.&quot;
  Blockbusting batsman Keith Stackpole, with 43 Tests under his belt, has
no doubts when it comes to his choice as the best.
  &quot;Ian Chappell was the best I ever played under, then Bill Lawry and Bobby
Simpson in that order,&quot; he said.
  &quot;I rate Ian the best because his style of captaincy suited me.  We would
both rather win a match than have it peter out into a dull draw.
  &quot;Bill was more of a defensive captain but he showed the young fellows the
right attitude although he didn't have quite the same material as Ian.
  &quot;And Simmo was a great inspiration because he was always so terribly
energetic.&quot;  
  Channel 9 commentator Bill Lawry also names Richie Benaud as the best ever
- with Ian Chappell second.  He would not name a third.
  &quot;Richie was a tremendous captain,&quot; he said.  &quot;He was the first of the
modern captains to really appreciate what was needed in modern cricket.
  &quot;The series in which he captained Australia against the West Indies in
1961 started a tremendous boost for cricket.
  &quot;He has done a fantastic amount for both Australian and world cricket
and I've never seen or played with anyone better.
  &quot;Ian Chappell had a tremendous record as a captain and a player and,
statistically, he was also one of the best.
  &quot;His own natural ability shone through and he always led from the front.&quot;
  Cricket commentator Richie Benaud said there were only two standout Australian
captains he's seen - Keith Miller and Ian Chappell.
  &quot;Keith was captain of NSW and although he never captained Australia at
Test level I still consider him the best, with Ian,&quot; he said.
  &quot;They are the top two - all the others are of about equal standard.
  &quot;The reason they were so good is because they had imagination apart from
their skill and leadership qualities.
  &quot;They had a very good knowledge of the game and were always willing to
take a gamble.&quot;
