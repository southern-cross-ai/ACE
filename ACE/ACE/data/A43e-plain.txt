Where to live?  

WHERE to live is an important feature of most older people's lives.  Retirement
will almost certainly be a time when you reassess your housing needs.
  Jan Bowen, in her excellent guide, Know Your Rights When You Retire (Bay
Books), says the main options people should consider are:
  To continue to live in their own home.
  To buy something smaller; that is a home unit.
  To live in a rented home.
  To move to a retirement village.
  While the availability of medical care and support services is obviously
important to consider, it is worth being aware that only 8 per cent of older
people need the institutional care offered by a hostel or nursing home.
  Fifteen per cent of people need support services in their own home and
the rest (about 77 per cent) live at home just as they always have.
Moving to a unit is a popular option for those people whose families have
moved away from home.  Many units have the advantage that maintenance of
gardens, etc, is the responsibility of a manager.
  Retirement villages are a relatively new and increasingly popular
choice for retired people or people approaching retirement.  Some villages
accept residents of 50 or 55 years of age and many people are choosing to move
in and establish their lives before they retire.
  Whatever you decide to do, you will need to be aware of the laws which
apply to selling a home, or to buying a home or home unit or retirement
village unit.
 Alternatively you may need to know how the law applies to altering a home
and to renting a home.
  There are a number of government concessions to help low income earners
with housing costs.
  Even if the family has grown up and moved out, many people still prefer
to stay in the home they have always lived in.
  They might like the area and be close to family, friends, familiar shops,
library and other services, especially health services.
