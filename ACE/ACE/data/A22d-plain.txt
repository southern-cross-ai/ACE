Sack fear ties hands: union  

SHOP assistants feared the sack for industrial action, a Shop Distributive
and Allied Employees union organiser said yesterday.
  Ms Margaret Bennett said many were married women with children who had
to support their families.
  "The boss will walk into the office and say anyone who goes to the protest
rally is out," she said.
  One casual at Kmart, Toowomba, who declined to be named, said yesterday
she lived 20km from work and could not get transport late at night or afford
a late-night babysitter.
  "The employers aren't going to pay your taxi fare home like they do in
the public service," she said.
  "I didn't tell my employer I was going to the union meeting today because
they can sack casuals any time." 
  She was not confident staff would back the union call to stop work for
a mass rally next Thursday.
  "Even the permanents are afraid of losing their jobs, and the juniors
are fresh out of school and won't speak up.
  "If we withdrew our labor, there's plenty of people on the dole or on
school holidays who would step in."
  Ms Bennett said a permanent worker under 16 was paid $124.80 a week. 
"Many have said if they had to work odd hours they may as well go on the
dole.
  "Single mothers may have to go on to supporting parent's benefits because
they can't leave their children at night," she said.
  Another casual said she would be afraid to walk 300 m to her car alone
after working late.
  Ms Bennett said:  "The Government has not considered the effects of
deregulation on ordinary people's lives.
