Skylark at skyscraper By KESTER VAN AS  

  The Riverside Centre opened to the public today, with a special breakfast
for new tenants, Brisbane service clubs and ferry passengers.
  As part of the morning celebrations, a street theatre band sang and danced
its way through more than 200 onlookers, as a hot air balloon hovered.
  Later, people were treated to a display by a team of 12 parachutists and
a waterski show on the Brisbane River.
  Interstate architects are expected at the celebrations to see Brisbane's
tallest building, which is rated as one of the most technically advanced
in Australia.
  The 147m tower contains Brisbane's state-of-the-art stock exchange, which
began operations in August after 20 years at Network House in Queen Street.
  The centre also has Brisbane's latest "eateries", including Michael's
Restaurant and its $1 million wine cellar.
  On Sunday, the Great Ferry Boat Race starts at 11.30am from the Regatta
Hotel, Toowong, and finishes at the Riverside Centre.
  Celebrations continue through to October 11, when they will end in a
fireworks display.
  The official opening will take place in February next year.
