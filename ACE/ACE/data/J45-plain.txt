[¶91-626] In the marriage of LEE STEERE, C.P. and LEE STEERE,
                 T. Full Court of the Family Court of Australia at Perth.
                 Judgment delivered 12 August 1985. 
                 Full text of judgment below.  

Family law - Property - Principles applicable to farming properties 
- Correct approach to sec. 79 application - Contribution as a 
homemaker and parent - Inherited property - Financial resources 
and needs - Inclusion of legal costs in assessment of financial 
resources - Effect of proposed order on earning capacity - Family 
Law Act 1975, sec. 79.

  The husband and wife were married in 1975. At the time of the
marriage the husband brought into the marriage a farming
property transferred from his father and an interest in an
adjoining property. The wife brought about $2,000 into the
marriage.

  Throughout the marriage the husband ran the farm. The wife had
the responsibility for rearing the children of the marriage and
running the home. In addition she gave the husband assistance
on the farm when required. The parties separated on 14 May
1983.
                               
  The wife filed an application in March 1984 in which she sought
the sum of $180,000 by way of settlement of property and lump
sum maintenance together with $100 per week maintenance for the
children. At the time of trial the husband's net assets
amounted to approximately $670,000. The wife's assets totalled
$10,500. In addition she had a credit of $42,751 from a family
trust. Her liabilities, including estimated legal costs, were
about $16,000. The trial Judge made orders for the payment of
$70,000 to the wife and child maintenance of $85 per week.

  The wife appealed as to the lump sum-awarded on the basis
that the trial Judge had erred in that: (i) he had approached
the matter partly on a needs basis and partly on a capacity to
pay basis, and that this was not a permissible approach under
sec. 79 of the Family Law Act 1975; (ii) the wife's
contribution to the family and the property should be
recognised in a substantial and not a token way; (iii) even on
a needs approach the trial Judge's views were inappropriate;
(iv) the trial Judge had disallowed the wife's liability for
legal costs in considering her needs.

  Both parties agreed that, should the Court reach a conclusion
that the trial Judge had incorrectly exercised his discretion,
the Full Court should exercise its discretion and substitute an
appropriate figure rather than remit the matter for further
trial.

  Held: 

 Farming properties  

  (a) In relation to farming properties, as in relation to all
other assets be they business assets or suburban land, the
ordinary principles of sec. 79 apply. There is no "farming
case" exception to the ordinary principles applicable under
sec. 79 (Magas and Magas (1980) FLC ¶90-885 followed).

 Correct approach to a sec. 79 application  

  (b) An application under sec. 79 should first commence with the
assessment of the contributions made by each of the parties
under sec. 79(4)(a), (b) and (c). Secondly, the financial
resources, means, needs of the parties and other matters set
out in sec. 75(2) so far as relevant should be considered
(Pastrikos and Pastrikos (1980) FLC ¶90-897 followed).

 Contribution as homemaker and parent  

  (c) It is possible to arrive at the conclusion that in a
marriage there has been equality of contribution by each of the
parties within his or her own sphere - that of the wife as a
good homemaker and parent, and that of the husband as
breadwinner (Mallet and Mallet (1984) FLC ¶91-507 extensively
discussed).

  (d) If the parties at the inception of the marriage acquire a
farm for value and build it up through equal efforts in their
respective spheres, the conclusion that the contributions are
equal would be difficult to resist (Magas and Magas (supra)).

 Inherited property  

  (e) If inherited or donated property was acquired before
marriage, and especially where it was worked and developed by
the party who received it before marriage, that is an important
consideration. 

  (f) The strength of a contribution made at the inception of a marriage is
eroded, not by the passage of time, but by the off-setting contribution
of the other spouse.

 Legal costs  

  (g) In a realistic assessment of the financial resources of the parties
it is proper to include any legal costs each of the parties may have to
pay, subject to any reimbursement by way of an order for costs. This should
not be viewed as a backdoor method of awarding costs.

 Earning capacity  

  (h) Section 79(4)(d), which directs the Court to consider the effect of
any proposed order on the earning capacity of either party to the marriage,
is mainly relevant to the question of the ways and means in which the
entitlement of a party can be met. If injustice can only be avoided by the
sale and division of the business property then this must be done (Magas
and Magas (supra)).

 The present case  

  (i) The trial Judge did not correctly approach the issues in the case. He
based his decision on the needs of the wife and the capacity of the husband
to raise a sum while still retaining the farming assets. This was incorrect
in principle and led to an inappropriate result.

  (j) Appeal allowed. The husband was ordered to pay to the wife the sum of
$165,000, to be paid by instalments.

  Appearances: Mr M.H. Holden of counsel (instructed by Lavan Solomon) for
the appellant wife; Mr K.G. Forrest of counsel (instructed by Ilbery Barblett
& O'Dea) for the respondent husband.

  Before: Fogarty, Maxwell and Nygh JJ.

  Fogarty, Maxwell and Nygh JJ.: By Notice of Appeal dated 21 January 1985
the appellant T. Lee Steere appealed against orders 3 and 4 of certain orders
made by his Honour Judge Anderson on 21 December 1984 after a hearing on
28-30 November 1984. Those orders were:

  "3. As and by way of settlement of property and lump sum maintenance the
  husband do pay to the wife on or before the 28th day of February 1985
  the sum of $70,000.

  4. From and including the 1st day of February 1985 the husband do pay
  to the wife interest on the said sum of $70,000 or so much thereof as
  remains owing from time to time at the rate of 15% per annum calculated
  daily.

  5. The husband who resides at Elderslie via Boyup in the State of Western
  Australia do pay to the Collector of Maintenance at 45 St George's Terrace,
  Perth in the said State for disbursement by him to the wife who resides
  at Balga in the said State maintenance for the said children at the rate
  of $85 per week apportioned as to $30 per week each in respect of N and
  A and as to $25 per week in respect of M the first payment thereof to
  be made on the 21st day of December 1984.

  6. The husband indemnify and keep the wife indemnified in respect of any
  income tax liability for the year ended the 30th day of June 1984 including
  any interest or penalties and thereafter keep the wife further indemnified
  in respect of any income tax liability including any interest or penalties
  arising out of income from any trust or partnership in which the husband
  and wife together participated.   

  7. The interest (if any) of the husband in the motor vehicle presently
  in the possession of the wife vest in the wife.

  8. The wife do assign to the husband any interest she has in any partnership
  in which the husband and wife participated.

  9. There be no order for costs of the proceedings against the wife."

(By orders 1 and 2 the wife was granted the sole guardianship and custody
of the three children of the marriage and detailed orders were made as to
access. It is unnecessary to set out the detail of those orders.)

  The parties were married on 15 February 1975, their ages then being
approximately 31 and 29 respectively. They finally separated on 14 May 1983,
a period of approximately 8 years, but there were other short periods of
separation during the marriage. During the course of the marriage there
were three children born to the parties, namely N born on 6 March 1976 so
that her present age is 9, A born on 5 October 1978 and now aged 7, and
M born on 3 September 1980 and now aged 6. All of these children have lived
with the wife since separation and it is anticipated that this will continue
to be the case.

  In her application filed on 14 March 1984 the wife sought the sum of
"$250,000 or such other sum as the Court deems fit in respect of property
settlement and lump sum maintenance". At the trial the orders which the
wife sought were that the husband pay to her the sum of $180,000 by way
of "settlement of property and lump sum maintenance" together with $100
per week maintenance for the three children of the marriage, the transfer
to her of a motor car which was then in her possession and an order that
the husband indemnify her in respect of a tax liability.

  That claim by the wife was particularised during the course of the trial
and was recorded by his Honour as follows:  

  "The wife put in a statement that her immediate needs were:

   1. A three bedroomed, low maintenance house in 
     Morley/Noranda area                           $70,000 2. New or second-hand reasonable car              10,000 3. Liabilities, say                               20,000
                                                  --------
                                                  $100,000 
                                                  --------      
The liabilities of $20,000 included an amount of $10,000 for the wife's
  anticipated legal expenses but this was subsequently reduced to $8,500.
  In opening it was stated that the wife's intention was to invest the balance
  and with the maintenance she would receive for the children, live on the
  income produced."

  The position adopted by the husband at the trial was that he should pay
to the wife by way of settlement and future maintenance a total of $70,000
and pay a total of $60 per week maintenance for the three children. There
was apparently no dispute at the trial about the orders in relation to the
motor car or the tax liability. The cases of the parties also proceeded
on the basis that the wife would assign to the husband her interest in a
partnership in which they were involved and that is embodied in order 8.
 
  Neither party has appealed against the orders in respect of maintenance.
The issue on this appeal was the correctness of his Honour's order under
sec. 79 in awarding the wife the sum of $70,000. Before us both counsel
conducted their cases upon the basis that in the event that the Court concluded
his Honour had not correctly exercised his discretion and that the appeal
for that reason should be allowed, the preferable course for this Court
was to exercise its discretion and substitute an appropriate figure rather
than remit the matter for further trial. Both counsel also agreed that the
case should be conducted on the basis of an application of sec. 81 so as
to encompass the wife's future maintenance.

  The facts as found by the trial Judge were not the subject of any serious
challenge before us and consequently it is convenient to turn to the findings
of the fact and the history of the matter as his Honour recorded them in
his judgement.

  His Honour after setting out the background marital facts and the nature
of the claims before him and after making some general observations to which
we will return later dealt with the history of the parties prior to their
marriage.

  So far as the husband is concerned, his Honour found that after he had
completed two years at an agricultural college the husband commmenced working
on his father's farm known as "Elderslie" in the south west of Western
Australia, a property concerned in sheep, cattle and coarse grain production.
His Honour recorded that "the husband is a farmer and has been for the whole
of his working life.
