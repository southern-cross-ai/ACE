	<h> PCs take to the congressional campaign trail </h>

  When the Unites States Congress adjourned last week ahead of the November 4 
election, congressmen from across the country returned to their home 
districts to campaign for re-election.
  These, however, are days different from any other in US politics, thanks to 
the growing use of personal computers by political groups for both 
sophisticated and mundane tasks.
  A Washington DC-based consulting company, Electronic Data Services (EDS), 
for example, uses an IBM PC and specialised mapping software to analyse 
demographic information.
  The office of Wisconsin State senator, Mr Lloyd Kincaid, recently acquired a 
Sperry PC to perform traditional political grunt work - word processing and 
mass mailings.
  During the 1984 presidential campaign, workers for the eventual loser, Mr 
Walter Mondale, were the first to use PCs in a national campaign. 
  &quot;There's no doubt that computers have an application for us,&quot; Mr Kincaid's 
administrative aide, Mr Dan Satran, said.
 &quot;We got our equipment from another senator who had lost in the primary, so we 
really didn't have to do any shopping around.&quot; 
  On the national level, EDS is using five networked IBM PCs along with the 
Atlas advanced mapping package from Strategic Locations Planning Incorporated 
of San Jose, California, to perform demographic research and consulting for 
the Democratic Party.  
  &quot;We take census information, which includes demographics such as age, race 
and income, and combine it with political information such as voter 
registration and turnout numbers,&quot; an EDS research associate, Mr Dale Tibbits, 
said.
   The Atlas program, a general purpose mapping package that constructs maps 
and then displays the corresponding data, is linked to a Hewlett-Packard 
plotter for the production of full-colour maps which display demographic 
information for particular geographic regions.
  For example, if we find that a candidate's support comes from one 
particular precinct, we can tell you what racial and economic groups make up 
that precinct and how you can use this information strategically,&quot;  Mr Tibbits 
said.
  &quot;Because of our ability to combine census and political information, we can 
tell you where you should be concentrating your broadcasting money, where to 
set up campaign headquarters and other strategic decisions.&quot;
  In the State of Michigan, the Republican candidate for governor, Mr Dan 
Murphy, used an Apple Macintosh and the business file-vision graphic 
database from Telos Software of Santa Monica, California, to aid*aide financial 
decisions such as media spending and campaign appearances.  
  &quot;Michigan has an especially rigorous campaign financing law,&quot; Mr Murphy's 
campaign director, Mr Dick Southern, said.
  &quot;It's very important to target your funds carefully.&quot;
