&quot;Would you like to lie in bed with her?&quot; asked Mr. Gorham.
  I flushed. &quot;Yes,&quot; I answered.
  &quot;Did you hear that?&quot; yelled Mr. Booker. &quot;The Coat's just admitted he'd
like to lie in bed with Jean Ferguson!&quot;
  &quot;I hope you use a french letter, Coat,&quot; said Mr. Street.
  &quot;There's enough bastards around already,&quot; agreed Louis Jessup.
  &quot;You can say that again!&quot; exclaimed Mr. Bear.
  &quot;You oughtta know, Teddy,&quot; said Zach McLaurence.
  &quot;I wouldn't mind sleeping with her myself,&quot; leered Mr. Gorham.
  &quot;Is she good in bed, Coat?&quot; asked Mr. Street.
  &quot;Tell you what, Coat,&quot; said Bob Booker. &quot;I've got a french letter in my
desk I can lend you.&quot;
  &quot;Second-hand, of course,&quot; said Sporrie.
  &quot;Erk!&quot; grimaced Mr. Gorham.
  &quot;Full of colly-wobbles is it, Bob?&quot; asked Louis Jessup.
  &quot;I've only used it once!&quot;
  &quot;Erk!&quot;
  &quot;Have you popped the question yet, Coat?&quot; continued Booker.
  &quot;Well, no, I haven't.&quot;
  &quot;Tell you what, Coat! I'll pop round and tell her.&quot;
  &quot;Don't do that!&quot;
  But ignoring my protestation, Booker sailed out the door.
  The laughter had scarcely abated, when Mr. Kennel walked in. A little
man with horn-rimmed spectacles, Mr. Kennel was Chief Teller in Accounts
Section. &quot;Where's the boss?&quot; he asked.
  &quot;Gone to see about a broken clock,&quot; said Sporrie, picking his nails.
  Kennel surveyed the damage. &quot;How did that happen?&quot; he asked.
  &quot;Fell down, I guess,&quot; replied Sporrie, again without looking up.
  &quot;Anything we can do you for, Jed?&quot; asked Mr. Rochester.
  &quot;I think I'll just wait till he comes back.&quot; So saying, Kennel strolled
to the top of the room and calmly sat down in Witcharde's chair.
  A few minutes later, Horrie Waterman came in and began distributing an
Information Circular from the Association.
  &quot;Getting a bit sensational, aren't we, Horrie?&quot; commented Mr. Gorham.
  And indeed we were! The circular was headed CRITICISM OF POLICE METHODS
and ran as follows:-
           
	<h> SEARCH WITHOUT WARRANT </h>
	
The methods of the Commonwealth Investigation Service in the Sales Tax
Office have been bitterly criticised by incensed members following the recent
search of an officer's private home.
  After undergoing a sustained ordeal of handwriting tests and interrogation
the officer was bundled into a car and driven away by three powerful-looking
well-built investigators.
  Only when the car had travelled some distance was the officer told the
investigators were going to his home. On arrival the investigators &quot;invited&quot;
the officer to let them search the premises without a warrant.
  The officer, who maintains his innocence of any malpractice, was subjected
to humiliating questioning without being told the nature of the offence
he was suspected of committing. His wife was ill and expecting a child at
the time and he was reduced to a state of extreme nervous tension.
  Later he was sent back to his desk and left without any indication of
what was going to happen to him next.
  The methods of enquiry and search were so unusual that citizens generally
may well wonder what the Commonwealth investigators will be capable of doing
when they start full-scale operations under the new Federal Police legislation.
            
	<h> INVESTIGATOR TALKS OF &quot;MURDER&quot;</h>
	
Having found no evidence of wrong-doing by the officer, the investigators,
with apparent relish, took possession of a war-time souvenir pistol found
abandoned in the bottom of a wardrobe.
  When an Association official enquired what the investigators were going
to do with the pistol, he was told it would be treated as an &quot;unlicensed
revolver&quot;.
  It was explained to the investigators that the pistol was given to the
officer during the war by an Air Force mate who was later killed in action.
The gun had not been used since and when the officer returned from the war
it was thrown aside and forgotten.
  With something like the melodrama of a fifth rate detective novel one
of the investigators quite seriously told the Association official that
the revolver might be a &quot;missing murder weapon.&quot;
  The pistol was rusted, broken, old and useless. It was about as incapable
of being fired as the Commonwealth Investigation Service apparently is of
solving the &quot;extra man mystery.&quot;
  &quot;I don't know that you had any right to print all that, Horrie,&quot; complained
Mr. Gorham.
  &quot;Who was it, Horrie?&quot; asked Mr. Street.
  &quot;Wasn't me - that's for bloody sure!&quot; said Wakington-Snell.
  &quot;What's all this `extra man' crap?&quot; asked Mr. Street.
  &quot;Well, I told her, Coat,&quot; said Booker, breezing back. &quot;She said she'd
be happy to sleep with you any time.&quot;
  I knew she had not said anything of the sort, but I raced around to Records
all the same. &quot;Has Booker been speaking to you about me?&quot; I asked.
  &quot;Yes; he has.&quot;
  &quot;I hope you didn't take any notice of what he said.&quot;
  &quot;No; I didn't.&quot;
  &quot;That's all right, then.&quot;
  Just as I returned, Witcharde came in the other way. Fortunately, his
attention was distracted by Kennel. &quot;There you are!&quot; exclaimed that worthy.
&quot;I see you've got a broken clock.&quot;
  &quot;Did you fix that chair?&quot;
  &quot;Yes,&quot; replied Southey. &quot;Everything under control.&quot;
  Witcharde tore up two forms he was carrying, and sat down beside Rochester.
  &quot;Don't worry about me,&quot; said Kennel. &quot;I've got all day.&quot;
  &quot;Get stuffed,&quot; answered Witcharde.
  Kennel made no attempt to execute this order, and Witcharde went on talking
to Rochester. They were discussing Waterman's Circular.
  This stalemate seemed set to continue indefinitely, when there was a sudden
commotion in the direction of Accounts Section.
  &quot;Man overboard!&quot; It was old Gruber's voice. There was the sound of running
feet in the corridor outside. Then tumult. &quot;Mann the lifeboats!&quot; Gruber
was screaming. &quot;Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!&quot; - &quot;Fire!&quot; some-one shouted. &quot;Fire!&quot; -
&quot;Fire!&quot;
  We sat at our desks like statues of ice. 
  Witcharde dived for the door.
  The corridor was choked with pandemonium. Females were screaming, wielding
their purses like clubs, their bodies for battering rams. &quot;Fire!&quot;, &quot;Fire!&quot;
It was every woman for herself; clawing frantically at those in front; being
clawed by those behind. &quot;Fire!&quot;, &quot;Fire!&quot; Using the heels of their shoes
like spurs to a horse, the gentler sex battled their way down the stairs.
&quot;Fire!&quot;, &quot;Fire!&quot; The call re-echoed from floor to floor.
  At last we were in the street.
  &quot;Some-one stop the traffic!&quot; But there was no need. An impenetrable barrier
of human flesh spilled across the road-way. The pressure was increasing.
I slipped down King Street and caught a tram to the Uni.

&quot;Where did you get to, yesterday, Mr. Howard?&quot; Spindel's tone was cold and
sarcastic.
  &quot;I took myself out to the University, if it's any business of yours.&quot;
I could see Carrier's jaw drop, out of sympathy I suppose.
  &quot;I think it is our business, Mr. Howard, when you take yourself off, without
permission,&quot; continued Spindel.
  &quot;I think I acted rather wisely, considering the circumstances.&quot;
  &quot;You'll have to fill in a leave form, and you'll be docked for the time
you were absent. That's all, Mr. Howard.&quot;
  &quot;I refuse to fill in the form.&quot;
  &quot;In that case, I have no alternative, but to report your conduct to the
D.C.&quot;
  &quot;I would welcome the opportunity. And I shall seek an interview for myself.&quot;
I thought better of it, however, and returned to I.E.s. &quot;Spindel reckons
he's going to dock the time from my pay,&quot; I explained to the room at large.
  &quot;He can't do that, Coat,&quot; said Booker. &quot;We were all in the pub, and he's
not doing anything about that.&quot;
  &quot;He'd better not!&quot; exclaimed Wakington-Snell with surprising vehemence.
  &quot;No. I should say not,&quot; agreed Rochester.
  &quot;What will I do about it?&quot; I asked.
  &quot;You want to write a letter to the D.C.,&quot; suggested Sporrie.
  &quot;That's a good idea,&quot; I said. Witcharde came in. Under his beady eye, I
removed all the files from the top of my desk, took out a sheet of ruled
foolscap, and wrote the following memo:-
                                          
	<misc> Internal Examinations </misc>
	
Yesterday afternoon, as you are doubtless aware, in Accounts section,
while Mr. Kennel was out of the room, a gust of wind blew a large number
of cheques that were on his desk out of the window. I only learnt of this
occurrence this morning. Yesterday afternoon, due to the carelessness of
Mr. Kennel and the irresponsibility of Mr. Gruber, I, along with most of
the staff, and half the building in fact, was made to feel that a fire had
broken out. I flatter myself that I am not a person to whom the spectacle
of a fire fulfills some vicarious amusement - chasing fire engines is a
habit I have long outgrown - and I therefore took myself away from the scene
so as not to hamper the efforts of such gallant fire-fighters as would
presently appear - or so I assumed.
  Mr Spindel has stated that I will be required to take the leave without
pay.
  It is submitted that, in view of the extraordinary circumstances outlined
above, Special Leave be granted.

The Deputy Commissioner of Taxation.
  I was tempted to add a proviso that, failing the grant of the Special
Leave, the pay be deducted form Gruber's salary, but I thought better of
it.
  Witcharde was still watching me. With an elaborate gesture, I placed the
memo in Rocky's In-tray.
  Later that morning, Rocky called me over. &quot;I take it, you're not planning
to spend very long in this department?&quot; he asked.
  &quot;Why's that, Rocky?&quot;
  &quot;This memo. If you put this through, you'll be finished for life.&quot;
  &quot;It's true, isn't it?&quot;
  &quot;That's not the point. It doesn't always pay to be truthful in this place.
Especially when you attack old Gruber. He's the white-haired boy.&quot;
  &quot;What's the matter with everyone? The man's a raving lunatic. Surely they
realise that, even from yesterday's incident.&quot;
  &quot;He just gets a bit excited, that's all. I suggest you tear up this memo,
if you want to stay here for any time.&quot;
  Like a coward, I took his advice. But having thrown Witcharde off his
guard, I thought it would be a good idea to pen a note to Jean Ferguson.
Due to the supervisory activities of Mr. King, our correspondence had rather
decreased of late. Most of my letters were made up of the most atrocious
puns and all manner of terribly juvenile devices.
  Her letters to me were much more interesting:
Tom Howard Q.C.
  The caption above looks impressive but don't be misled by it, for I think
the following parenthesis (brag, brag, brag) suits you better - You certainly
were not behind the door when the gab was handed out.
  So I am ignorant am I?
  Well, I am pleased to say I am not a walking dictionary like yourself.
  Sarcastic aren't I?
  Well, you ask for it sometimes, always pointing out my ignorance on not
knowing the literary characters that you have so painstakingly looked up
in the encyclopedia (never could spell that word seeing that I do not possess
one) but, undoubtedly, you possess stacks of them, and I bet you wouldn't
have to dust them either.
  Who is Descartes?
  Hiprophesis?
  Or, how long is the Suez canal?
  Or, maybe I could ask you a few points on sport, a subject you know
comparatively little about.
  Then I could also say &quot;Oh! you are so ignorant.&quot; As for reading the `Water
Babies' in kindergarten I am afraid I was far too much advanced for my years,
for I fancied literary works of Kathleen Windsor much better.
  Never mind Tom, I loved the ending of your letter.
  I might be dumb and ignorant but I have blue eyes, beautiful physiognomy
and a nice personality. 
  Oh! my, I simply curled up on the mat when I read that. 
  Don't upset me like that.
                                      Yours Truly,

Sir Charles Freeman,
  I appear to be getting more like you every day, what with colloquial
expressions and pseudonyms.
  (look that one up in the dictionary).
  Do you know what `Sidere mens eadem mutato' means? Well! I found out,
it means `Tempus fugit but the mind remains the same.' (Impressive, isn't
it?)
  Sitting at my desk yesterday, I was startled to find a masculine head
(combined with a husky voice) so intimately close to mine, and do you know
who the possessor of the head was?
