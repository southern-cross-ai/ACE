Textile industry protection debate swinging growers direction Canberra Comment
By David Kidd  

  CANBERRA - Consumer transfer from industry protection for textile clothing
and footwear (TCF) manufacturing is estimated at $1000 million a year,
with these industries getting one third of all protection provided to
manufacturing.
  The Industries Assistance Commission (IAC) has given the Government three
options for reductions in TCF protection - targets to 75 per cent, 50 per
cent and 25 per cent.
  Federal Cabinet is due to make an announcement on its protection policy
before the end of November.
  National Farmers Federation (NFF), miners and others have been campaigning
hard for a cut of at least half the assistance given to Australian TCF
manufacturers.
