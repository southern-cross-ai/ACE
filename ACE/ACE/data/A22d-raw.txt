	<h> Sack fear ties hands: union </h>
	

SHOP assistants feared the sack for industrial action, a Shop Distributive
and Allied Employees union organiser said yesterday.
  Ms Margaret Bennett said many were married women with children who had
to support their families.
  &quot;The boss will walk into the office and say anyone who goes to the protest
rally is out,&quot; she said.
  One casual at Kmart, Toowomba, who declined to be named, said yesterday
she lived 20km from work and could not get transport late at night or afford
a late-night babysitter.
  &quot;The employers aren't going to pay your taxi fare home like they do in
the public service,&quot; she said.
  &quot;I didn't tell my employer I was going to the union meeting today because
they can sack casuals any time.&quot; 
  She was not confident staff would back the union call to stop work for
a mass rally next Thursday.
  &quot;Even the permanents are afraid of losing their jobs, and the juniors
are fresh out of school and won't speak up.
  &quot;If we withdrew our labor, there's plenty of people on the dole or on
school holidays who would step in.&quot;
  Ms Bennett said a permanent worker under 16 was paid $124.80 a week. 
&quot;Many have said if they had to work odd hours they may as well go on the
dole.
  &quot;Single mothers may have to go on to supporting parent's benefits because
they can't leave their children at night,&quot; she said.
  Another casual said she would be afraid to walk 300 m to her car alone
after working late.
  Ms Bennett said:  &quot;The Government has not considered the effects of
deregulation on ordinary people's lives.
