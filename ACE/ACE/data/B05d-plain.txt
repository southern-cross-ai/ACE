THE Sun SAYS 

MR HOWARD correctly identifies lower taxes, excessive union power and smaller
government  as issues now in the mainstream of Australian life.
  
  Those also happen to to be issues which the New Right has highlighted
and - with union work practices - pushed to the limit.

  But the Opposition Leader is mistaken if he thinks he can claim the "freedom
and independence" of the Liberal Party as a magic formula for warding off
the New Right's more extreme pressures.
  
  He is kidding himself, just as was the New Right guru and former Treasury
head, Mr John Stone, when he said the aims of the H.R.Nicholls Society lay
outside party politics.

  Ideas are the true currency of politics. It takes more than wishful thinking
to keep a particular set of ideas out of the political process.

  Some New Right thinking has already found public approval and is nudging
the Liberals to positions where Mr Howard feels more comfortable. He should
be grateful.

  What he must guard against is the extremism which, in unstable economic
times, would welcome a "strong leader" arriving on horseback to rescue the
nation.
  
  Mr Howard, under pressure, could then find that his "free and independent"
Liberals are part of Australian life - not above it.
