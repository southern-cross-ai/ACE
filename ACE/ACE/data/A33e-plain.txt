Custodian gets land title  

  Federal Aboriginal Affairs Minister, Mr Clyde Holding, arrived in Darwin
unannounced yesterday and handed over title for the most contentious land
parcel in Kakadu National Park.
  Traditional Bunitj custodian, Mr Bill Neidjie, a patient in Royal Darwin
Hospital, accepted the Aboriginal land title to the Jabiluka National Land
Trust.
  Mr Holding said his sudden decision was based on compassionate grounds
after "Big Bill" was admitted to hospital on Friday with pneumonia.
  "This is a serious condition for a person his age and circumstances,"
Mr Holding said.
  "And I felt obliged to ensure the early delivery of the title for which
he and his people had waited so long."
  Aboriginal title for the mineral-rich area of about 400 km2 or 7 per cent
of Kakadu National Park stage 2, was first recommended under the South
Alligator River stage 2 land claim on July 3, 1981.
  Mr Holding said in making his decision he had taken into account recent
submissions from the NT Government and mining giant Peko EZ.
  The area, including the multi-million dollar Ranger 68 deposit, was the
subject of legal action since the minister indicated his intention to grant
the remaining land in 1983.
  The NT Government sought an injunction last month to prevent the minister
recommending the grant to the Governor-General, Sir Ninian Stephen.
  Mr Holding revoked his decision and gave the NT Government and Peko EZ
further opportunity to make submissions.
  Surprised
  "I received these submissions and considered them closely along with
other relevant material," Mr Holding said.
  Mr Holding claimed the granting of title was not related to the Federal
Government's decision to ban mining in Kakadu National Park stages 1 and
2.
  Mr Holding's visit surprised the Northern Land Council, the NT Government,
and the Darwin-based National Media Liaison Unit which did not know his
intentions until after 6pm yesterday.
