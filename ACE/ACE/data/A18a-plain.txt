Cashing in on croc craze BRISBANE  

- You've seen the movie, now you can buy the pub.
  The Walkabout Creek Hotel, star attraction of the box office hit Crocodile
Dundee, is on the market and offers are rolling in.
  And a north Queensland man whose arm was bitten off by his five-metre
pet crocodile is set to cash in on the Dundee fever in the US.  
  The hotel, otherwise known as the Federal McKinlay Hotel, is at McKinlay,
a 20-house town 100 km south of Cloncurry in north-west Queensland.
  Success on the silver screen has rocketed the quiet country pub to stardom
with tourist coaches regularly stopping in McKinlay, according to publican
Mr Peter Ferris.
  The movie has meant so much to the hotel's image the Licensing Commission
has been asked to approve a change of name - to the Walkabout Creek, of
course.
  The facade of the hotel was changed for the movie and restored to its
original outback look when filming was complete.
  The selling agent, Ms Jenny Olsen, of L J Hooker Townsville, said the
novelty value of the property had attracted wide interest, especially from
buyers who wanted to make use of land around the hotel.
  Meanwhile Alf Casey, 69, a cane farmer from O'Connell River, 950 km north
of Brisbane, will appear on the Fox Network television stations owned by
Rupert Murdoch.
  "I think the American interest is a result of Crocodile Dundee. I expect
they will want me to talk about my recent experience," said Mr Casey, who
leaves for the US next week.
