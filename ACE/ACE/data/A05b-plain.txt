  Safeways is inviting sealed tenders for the parcel, although Woolies has the 
right to nominate a friendly buyer if it can find one prepared to match the 
winning offer.
  By contrast, Coles Myer eased to $4.83 in London to wipe out most of 
Friday's gain.
  Overall, Australian industrial shares were virtually untested in London 
although most prices held firm.
  One stock continuing to attract international investors was News 
Corporation at a record $29.10 in late London trading following a 60c jump 
to $29 in Sydney.
  Banks attracted light demand from U.S. bargain hunting.
  Westpac closed at $4.55, ANZ at $5.20 and National Australia at $5.28.
  Hooker continued to firm, closing at $2.40, but Lend Lease eased to $8.45.

encouraged initial UK and European buying of selected gold shares and leading 
miners.

Central Norseman was steady at $15.30.
  Kidston at $8 was steady on Sydney's lower price, but Placer Pacific looked
