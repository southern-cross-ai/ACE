The Public Relations Committee of the W.A. Branch of A.A.S.H. has recently
completed its second video programme called &quot;YouthYak - Teenagers with Language
Learning Disability&quot; as part of the Branch's contribution to the International
Year of Youth.

The main aims of the programme are:-
1. to raise community awareness the existence*existance of language
   learning disabilities and limited communication skills among teenagers
2. to provide information about the nature of communication disorders
   that arise in the teenage population  
3. to offer some strategies that teachers, parents and others can use to 
   enhance the communication skills of the young and
4. to alert the community to the need for parents and care givers to
   provide varied and stimulating language environments for very young children.

The programme runs for 27 minutes and can be used to stimulate discussion
and broaden attitudes among teachers, guidance officers, school health nurses
and psychologists. Target audiences also include parents and teenagers.
The video separated into three sections with short fade-outs provided so
that those watching can stop the tape and discuss the contents and implications
of each section.

&quot;YouthYak - Teenagers with Language Learning Disability&quot; starts by comparing
the communication skills of two teenage boys. &quot;Bobby&quot; competently*competantly
