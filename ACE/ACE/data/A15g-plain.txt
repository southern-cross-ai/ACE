Missing: one millionaire  

One of Perth's newest millionaires is missing.
  An anonymous man has won $1.5 million in Six-38 Pools but no 
one can find him to give him the good news.
  Pools spokeswoman Ms Bronwyn Badger said the house at the 
address on the pools coupon was for sale and the phone number was 
wrong.
  "We know who he is, but we haven't been able to reach him," Ms 
Badger said.  "We are trying our hardest."
