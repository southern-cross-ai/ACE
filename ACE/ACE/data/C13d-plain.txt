Sisters lead fifties party  

  Break out the Brylcream and pull on your bobby socks ... Le Rox is throwing
a party.
  And at the heart of festivities tonight will be a return to the fifties
led by the Sydney outfit Sophisticated Boom Boom.
  The band has visited Adelaide only once before when it quickly picked up
a big following.
  And since forming last November it has won support across Australia,
maintaining a tiring performance schedule.
  Fronted by the Boom Boom sisters (Jenny, Vika and Louise), the band
concentrates on tunes from the fifties and sixties which centred around
all-girl bands.
  As to why the sound should be successful in the eighties, Jenny has a
few ideas.
  "We have been very lucky from the start really," she said.
  "But as well as that I think our success is because we put on a bit of
a show with a few dance steps and laughs which seems to appeal to most people.
  "And, of course, the music itself is very interesting because of the
intricate vocal harmonies.
  "The fifties and sixties was probably one of the greatest eras in music
ever."
  The band has drawn its material from a wide range of artists of that
time, but Jenny feels one of the biggest influences has been The Shangrilas,
the group which originally recorded the song Sophisticated Boom Boom.
  A version recorded by the local girls climbed to number two on alternative
charts.
  "There were so many good bands in that era," Jenny said.
  "But the Shangrilas really captured the whole image of the Phil Spectre
sound with all those sound effects and everything."
  Those hoping to catch Sophisticated Boom Boom will have several chances
to see the group this week.
  The band will play at Le Rox tonight, Flinders Uni and Limbos tomorrow,
Adelaide Uni on Friday, Limbos on Saturday and The Bay Disco on Sunday.
