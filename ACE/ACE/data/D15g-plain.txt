Monday August 11 HOLY, HOLY, HOLY PRAY  
Almighty God, show me what it means to be holy as you are holy.

 READ  
Leviticus 6:24-30.

 THINK  
How do you understand the word 'holy'?

  What is described as 'holy' or 'most holy' in verses 25-27 and 29? How
does this fit with your definition of 'holy'?

  The basic statement about holiness in Leviticus is the reiterated claim
by God, 'I am holy' (for example 20:26). In fact, the motto of Leviticus
could well be 'You shall be holy for I am holy' (for example 11:45). Holiness
is primarily related to the character and being of God - his 'otherness'
or 'separateness'. Thus people or things become holy when they are separated
for and dedicated to God. And uncleanness therefore has nothing to do with
dirt or germs; rather it is unlikeness to God.
  The command in verses 27 and 28 must be seen in the light of this
understanding of holiness. Because of the holy blood on the priest's clothes
or on the cooking pot, these articles become holy and must be separated
from common use. So the garment and the pot must be washed carefully (or
destroyed in the case of a clay pot which could not be thoroughly scoured)
to prevent contact between these holy things and anything unclean.
  To us these prescriptions may seem strange. Yet the underlying principle
remains as true today as in Moses' time: the holy God cannot co-exist with
the unclean.
