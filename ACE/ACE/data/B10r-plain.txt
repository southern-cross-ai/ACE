Come clean on waste  

IF the MMBW and State Government have not caused your municipality's
residents to be concerned as to the siting for the new toxic waste dump,
then your area is one of the lucky ones.
  I feel strongly that the public relations exercise undertaken by the MMBW
and State Government is fast proving to be badly managed. It is causing
annoyance and concern to a vast number of communities and organisations
unnecessarily, all because, hypothetically  - "anywhere is a possible site,"
or so says Mr Allan Thompson of the MMBW.
  Surely, it is time that they can at least own up to where it will not
be going, and put an end to the unnecessary anxiety that is sweeping
Victoria. Let them show some guts, because their credibility for competency
is seriously declining.

 Mrs J. Love-Linay, Carrum Downs.
