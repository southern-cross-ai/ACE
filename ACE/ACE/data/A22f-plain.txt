Eighth Rhine leak in a month WALDSHUT, West German. -  

About 2.5 tonnes of a packaging chemical leaked from a factory into the
Rhine River yesterday.
  It was the eighth reported industrial accident along the river in a month.
  Officials said the polyvinyl chloride (PVC) leaked from the Lonza chemical
factory in Waldshut in extreme south-western West Germany when a worker
left a valve open.
  The spill was discovered when a resident noticed the Rhine turning shades
of green and white for a kilometre downstream from the plant.
  Mr Lorenz Fischer, a spokesman for the Baden-Wuerttemberg State Environment
Ministry in Stuttgart, said about 7 kg of the leaked substance had been in
concentrated form and "relatively poisonous".
  But he said it was unlikely to endanger fish and plant life because it
was lighter than water and would remain on the river's surface.
  Waldshut sits on the Rhine where the river forms the Swiss border.
  The town is about 60 km upstream from Basel, Switzerland, where a 30-tonne
spill of industrial chemicals on November 1 contaminated long stretches
of the Rhine downstream, mainly in West Germany.
