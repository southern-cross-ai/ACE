Management in schools  

  Education is big business. In SA, the Education Department employs 22,000
people and has a wage bill of about $590m. Yet there has been increasing
evidence - through disputes over staff appointments and planning and the
growth of such modern employment diseases as stress-related illness - that
the management of education needs a thorough overhaul.
  So the announcement by the Minister of Education, Mr Crafter of a major
review of staff management by a leading Australian expert on industrial
relations and personnel issues is most welcome. Professor Di Yerbury, of
NSW's Macquarie University, a United Nations consultant, has excellent
credentials for this important task, which will seek to improve management
practices, to the benefit of students as well as teachers. 
  The staff management problems within schools have been exacerbated by
several factors, not least economic pressures which demand greater value
from the money spent on education. There are other, apparently conflicting,
pressures from the decline in enrolments. While this could be seen as freeing
some teaching resources to cope with wider choices in curriculum for students,
it has not emerged in that light.
  Instead, the department and the SA Institute of Teachers have been in
conflict over "displacement" policies which have forced teachers to change
schools at short notice. And the issue of stress, which resulted in an
astounding $1m in compensation payments in the past financial year, has
become a major management problem which requires urgent attention. Professor
Yerbury has an exacting task ahead.
