World finance talks begin  

FINANCIAL leaders from 151 nations met today to discuss ways to resolve the 
conflict between the need to boost a stubbornly sluggish world economy and 
their own political and economic priorities.
  The meetings of the interim committee of the International Monetary Fund 
and World Bank will set the agenda for the joint IMF-World Bank annual 
conference, which formally opens on Wednesday, Sydney time.
  Over the weekend, the United States apparently failed to win promises from 
West Germany, Japan and other industrial countries to stimulate their 
economies beyond the exchange rate changes they have been promoting.
  US Treasury Secretary James Baker and his visiting counterparts declined to 
comment on the weekend meetings outside a formal statement.
