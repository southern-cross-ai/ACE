Charles, Di woo Wham LONDON, Sun  

- The Prince and Princess of Wales are being credited with
arranging a comeback by singing duo Wham.
  Wham has agreed to renew its partnership for a concert to help Prince Charles'
Inner City Aid project next summer.
  A dozen other rock stars also are expected to perform.
  Wham duo George Michael and Andrew Ridgely split after a farewell concert
at Wembley six months ago which attracted 75,000 fans.
  The pair were the first Western pop act to visit China.
  Prince Charles started the move for Wham after seeing them at the Live
Aid concert last year.
  Princess Diana is known to be a great fan of Wham.  It was her personal
plea which swayed the two to share the stage again, according to a newspaper
report.
