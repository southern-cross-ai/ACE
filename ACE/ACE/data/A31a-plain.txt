Video hope for missing boy SYDNEY:  

 Police hope the abductor of eight-year-old John Purtell may have
been filmed on video.
  John vanished during a junior rugby league carnival in Griffith last Saturday
and detectives said a number of home videos had been taken during the day.
  The missing boy disappeared from near the shower block at Griffith's
Jubilee Park shortly before he was due to head home.
  Yesterday, additional police from Sydney joined the search while divers
scoured Lake Wyangan, where the bodies of two Griffith schoolboys were found
late last year.
