	<h> U.S.POLL BLOW TO AUSTRALIA</h>
	

THE success of the Democrats in the US congressional elections is almost
as much a blow to Australia - and particularly to Australia's farmers -
as it is to President Ronald Reagan.
  The Democrats gained a majority in the Senate and consolidated their control
in the House of Representatives, making sure the last two years of the
President's term will be that much more difficult.
  Although the election was fought largely on local issues, it will be harder
for President Reagan to get congressional endorsement on matters like foreign
policy, and represents a significant increase in the power of his opponents.
  The bad news for Australia, however, is that the new Democrat majorities
will have a major influence on U.S. domestic matters, particularly the economy.

Protectionist policies
  Historically the Democrats - like Robert Daschle, the Congressman (now
Senator) who pressed for bigger farm subsidies earlier this year - favor
more protectionist policies in support of US manufacturers and primary
producers. This will undoubtedly have an adverse effect on exports from
Australia as well as on other nations competing with the US.
  A Democratic Congress, for instance, will undoubtedly be much more inclined
to block agricultural imports and subsidise grain sales, and it is significant
that the Republican losses were particularly heavy in the American farm
belt.
  Indeed the new Senate leader, Senator Robert Byrd, has already signalled
a bill to help American farmers. &quot;It is important for us to compete again
and to protect American jobs, to sell agricultural products abroad,&quot; he
said.
`Mugged in the market'
  Nor will the Democrats restrict their protectionist moves to agriculture.
Senator Byrd included steel and textile workers in his remarks, adding:
&quot;We're getting mugged in the international marketplace. We've got to put
a stop to it.&quot;
  For Australia this means it is even more imperative that we establish
competitive export industries and get our economic house in order by increasing
investment and achieving a realistic wages policy.
  The Democrat victory has shortened the road to Treasurer Paul Keating's
banana economy. If we don't act we'll be there before we realise it.
