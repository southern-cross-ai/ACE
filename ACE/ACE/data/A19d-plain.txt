It's snow glow for skiers  

SNOW skiing enthusiasts couldn't have wished for better conditions at
the weekend. 
  All resorts reported heavy falls.
  The resort manager at Mr Hotham said it was the best opening to the season
for several years.
  "It is as close as you can get for perfect skiing this early," he said.
  Most resorts recorded falls of 50 cm or more.
  But accompanying the falls were sub-zero temperatures.
  Yesterday's maximum for Mt Buller was a chilly minus 3 degrees after
the overnight low of minus 5.6 degrees.
  The weather bureau spokesman said more snow was likely over the next few
days.
  Even Queenslanders shivered yesterday. In the southern interior towns
of Stanthorpe, Warwick and Surat, the mercury dropped to minus 5.
