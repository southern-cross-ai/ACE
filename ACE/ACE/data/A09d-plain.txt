TREVOR FACES DEATH AGAIN DON'T RIDE AGAIN - DOCTOR From JOHN BILIC in MELBOURNE  

JUMPS jockey Trevor Webb has already put life's biggest hurdles behind him.
  Two weeks after being critically injured in a race fall at Werribee,
south-west of Melbourne, Webb is planning to defy family and medical advice
to ride again.
 "The fall has put a bit of wind up me, but I can't really wait until I
get back into it," he said.
  "It's something I've been brought up with."
  On October 27, Webb's mount Fair Smuggler fell and two other horses crashed
onto him.
  "I don't remember a thing after I went over," he said.
  A year ago Webb, 24, was involved in a race fall at Bendigo and was twice
declared clinically dead on his way to hospital.  
  Despite doctors telling him not to ride, Webb was quickly back in the saddle.
  This time, his family and doctors think it would be unwise to ride again.
  "I told them we would just see how it goes," he said.
  Webb, who suffered a badly fractured skull, will soon undergo another
operation.
