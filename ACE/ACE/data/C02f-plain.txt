Outback drama is already U.S. hit By JOHN WALSH  

OL' BLUE Eyes Frank Sinatra put his finger on fame in his song New York,
New York when he crooned: "If you can make it there, you'll make it anywhere."
  So the future looks good for the new Australian mini-series The Last
Frontier, which screened earlier this month in the US and was a hit not
only in New York, New York but Omaha, Nebraska, Three Forks, Montana and
just about everywhere else. 
  Now the four-hour Outback saga starring Dynasty's Linda Evans and our own 
Jack Thompson is coming to Sydney (Channel 10, Monday and Tuesday, 8.30pm).
  And producers McElroy and McElroy have good reason to expect it to repeat
its American success here.
  While the idea of a city woman displaced in the bush and having to fend
for herself isn't over-original, it is fleshed out with strong characters,
great acting and the wonderful scenery of the Outback.
  The show is ofen dramatic, but moves at a relaxed pace - just as life
does in central Australia.

 Dynamic  

The strength of The Last Frontier comes in some dynamic face-to-face
confrontations between the characters.
  Besides Evans and Thompson the mini-series stars Judy Morris, Jason Robards
and Tony Bonner.
  And director Simon Wincer and writer Michael Laurence have shown off the
considerable talents of this cast to advantage in some memorable one-on-one
scenes.
  The performance which will surprise a lot of people is that of Linda Evans,
who discards her Dynasty fineries to turn in acting that is definitely
not Krystle Does Alice Springs.
  Linda makes a believable job of playing widow Kate Hannon, the woman
from Los Angeles who finds herself Down Under battling to prevent her late
husband's cattle station being taken over by a ruthless rival.
  Tony Bonner plays Kate's short-lived husband Tom Hannon, while Jason
Robards is the scheming cattle baron Ed Stenning.
  Kate's decision to fight Stenning embroils her in a bitter feud involving
him and his daughter Meg (Judy Morris) - and leads to love with Stenning's
son Nick (Jack Thompson).

 Schmaltzy  
 
The Last Frontier's solid supporting cast includes Toni Lamond, John
Ewart, American teenagers Meredith Salenger and Peter Billingsley and local
youngsters Beth Buchanan and Asher Keddie.
  There is perhaps too much playing to the US market with some explanations
of common Australian expressions, and two too-schmaltzy scenes using Waltzing
Matilda and The Star Spangled Banner.
  But otherwise this is a first-class show.
