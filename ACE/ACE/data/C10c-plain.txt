Zany mob good for a laugh  By SHERYL CHEN  

WICKETY Wak fans rejoice - there's another Waks Work special on tonight.
  It's the third in a series made by the Queensland band for Channel 7.
  Waks Works III is hour-long compilation of comedy sketches, musical send-ups,
impersonations and spoofs of well-known television commercials.
  Wickety Wak's Tony Jeffrey, Peter MacKay, Rob Rosenlund, Pani Gibert and Greg
Doolan don dubious costumes and outrageous make-up for the variety
program. 
  The Brisbane-based group is renowned for its hilarious send-ups of
celebrities.  Professor Sumner Miller, Cyndi Lauper, Freddie Fender, Tina
Turner and the Leyland  Brothers all feature.
  But the band does have a serious side.
  Its members are professional musicians and have scored international
success with Moonlight Marvel.
  Wickety Waks' lead vocalist, Tony Jeffrey, was born in Ireland and has his singing career as a boy soprano in local eisteddfods.

   Reputation  

  When he moved to Australia he began working the cabaret circuit and was
selected to represent Australia in the Sopot Song Festival in Poland in
1970.
  The band's drummer, Peter Mackay, was born in Adelaide and has earned
a fun reputation for his send-ups of Mick Jagger, Rod Stewart, Joe Cocker
and Rolf Harris.
  Rob Rosenlund, who plays keyboards, is a Brisbane-born sheet-metal worker
who turned his professional life to music when he toured with the band Winston
Country.
  He joined Wickety Wak in 1978.
  Bass guitarist Pani Gilbert was born in New Zealand and moved to Australia
in 1962.
  This year he celebrates 10 years with the band Wickety Wak.
  Greg Doolan started playing guitar at the age of 15. He was a draughtsman
with the public service for five years, playing the Brisbane circuit part-time.
  He joined Wickety Wak in 1975 and is the master-mind behind the comical
send-ups.
  Waks Works III screens at 7.30.
