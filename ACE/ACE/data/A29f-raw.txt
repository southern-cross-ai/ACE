	<h> Warning of threat to wage fixing </h>
	


	<misc> MELBOURNE: </misc>
	

 The current system of wage fixing was under threat, the
director-general of the Confederation of Australian Industry's industrial
council, Mr Bryan Noakes, warned yesterday.
  He predicted that the system would end if there was continued industrial
action of the type since the national wage decision.
  But Mr Noake's warning came as an end of the petrol dispute appeared
to be in sight.
  He said that the Australian economy was being torn to shreds by
irresponsible union actions.
  &quot;The actions of the Storemen and Packers Union in particular over the past
week has cost the economy millions of dollars in lost production and has
imposed massive inconvenience on the ever suffering Australian public,&quot;
he said.
  &quot;This followed hard on the heels of similar action by the waterside workers
that also cost the economy dearly.&quot;
  Mr Noakes said that many unions seemed unable to appreciate the reality
of the economic crisis - and intent on finding ways to exacerbate the
problems.  
  He said that the industrial council decided at a meeting in Sydney
on Friday that employers had simply had enough of these actions.
  If they continued, the CIA would seek to have the national wage bench
reconvened to consider the future of the present wage-fixing system, he
said.
  Employers were not going to bear the cost of increases awarded through
the commission and also bear the cost of claims being pursued with industrial
action in the field.
  But petrol stations will begin receiving fuel today if striking oil workers
accept an industry peace package at mass meetings this morning.    
  The end to the nine-day dispute neared after 30 union delegates yesterday
agreed to recommend a return to work.
  The meeting of Federated Storeman and Packers' Union delegates accepted
the Arbitration Commission's recommendations for a return to work and a
re-negotiation of oil-industry wage rates.
