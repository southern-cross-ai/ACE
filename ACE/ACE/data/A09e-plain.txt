Star brims with a love for people By GLENN ROBBINS  

WAVERLEY Star's biggest asset in his Japan Cup lead-up is his preference
for humans, according to rider Lance O'Sullivan.
  Which is a rather unusual but huge plus for Waverley Star's preparation
considering he is segregated from other horses.
  "He doesn't mind being the only horse in a 20-stall complex," Lance said.
  "He's always preferred the company of humans to other horses.
  "It is hard to define why, but that's just his nature.
  "He's contented having the company of Paul (brother Paul O'Sullivan,
the co-trainer) and his strapper."
  Waverley Star emphasised his chances in Sunday week's Cup with an effortless
win in Tokyo over 1800m last Sunday.
  "He's pulled up perfectly and everything is fine," trainer Dave O'Sullivan
said from New Zealand today.
  But not so with the other Australasian representative, Cox Plate winner
Bonecrusher.
  Reports claim Bonecrusher has been fretting since beginning his
seven-day quarantine period last Saturday, which is no surprise since he's
a gelding.
  Bonecrusher is going into the Cup without local track experience and a
race for four weeks, whereas Waverley Star has proved he has fully adapted
to his new surroundings.
  Despite the great Australian interest in Sunday week's Cup, no television
network is willing to screen the race because of the fee asked by the Japan
Racing club.
