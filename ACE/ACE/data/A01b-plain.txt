Japan acts against dumping TOKYO:   

The Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) has started 
surveillance on the export prices of seven popular types of semiconductors in 
a bid to prevent dumping, MITI officials said last week. 
  The items under the strict surveillance, which started on October 1, were 
DRAM, EPROM, SRAM, ECL Logic and RAM, and microprocessors and controllers, 
they said.
  Under the system, Japanese manufacturers have to submit export details on 
each contract.  
  Japan and the United States agreed in August to prevent the dumping of 
Japanese-made semiconductors on the US market.
