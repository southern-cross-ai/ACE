Birthday specials  

INDIAN Affair, prestige Indian restaurant of Parramatta, is celebrating its 
sixth birthday all this month with specially-discounted menus at lunch Tues-
Fri and dinner Mon-Thurs.
  Enjoy two generous courses of the excellent Indian Affair food for $15.90 or 
three courses for $19.90.  Choose from the whole menu.  Boiled rice is served.
  Indian Affair also has its usual a la carte menu at lunch (Tues-Fri) and at 
dinner seven nights a week.  Dishes can be ordered mild, medium or hot.
  Ever since it opened, people from all over have returned 
repeatedly to Indian Affair.
  I've been there at least half a dozen times: always to praise the food (for 
its flavor and freshness) and the helpful service provided by owner Dr 
Joseph Sethi, his family and staff.
  Entertainment (seven nights) includes belly dancer Noora Fridays, Western 
music Saturday and Sardool on sarod other nights.  Dr Sethi himself sings 
light Indian folk and film songs every Saturday.
  Particularly popular among entrees is the luscious tandoori chicken and the 
satays.
  Rogan Josh (Kashmiri lamb), Bombay beef, beef vindaloo and moglai chicken 
(favorite of emperors) are much-ordered main courses.
  Specials are served at weekends.
  Barfi and gulab jamun (both made by Dr Sethi's wife Joy, who supervises the 
kitchen) are the main desserts with kulfi a regular special.
  Indian Affair is a family affair with Dr Sethi's son Neville manager, his 
daughter Vanita hostess and daughter-in-law Jill helping.
