Seoul blast reopens Olympic wounds By PETER WILSON  

TOKYO. - The worst nightmare of the Olympic movement was reborn at Seoul's
Kimpo airport with a bomb blast that tore the air with slivers of glass
and metal and took five lives.
  Sunday's devastation raised the memory of Munich in 1972 and the horrifying
possibility of far worse carnage in Seoul in 1988.
  It also proved what a breathtaking risk the International Olympic Committee
took when it decided to hold the 1988 Games in the tense, divided battle-field
that is the Korean Peninsular.
  A giant political time bomb now hangs over Seoul's Olympic stadium, and it
may go off at any time in the countdown to this Saturday's Asian 
Games.
