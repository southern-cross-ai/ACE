He's my type of man, says Joh  

THE Premier, Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen, last night said he liked and respected
Mr Rupert Murdoch and complimented him on his Herald and Weekly Times takeover
bid.
  Speaking from Weipa, Sir Joh said: "Mr Murdoch's a progressive man who
has been known to myself for a long time.
  "We've always got on well and I'm sure we'll continue to do so.
 "He's a private-enterprise type of man and that's the type of man I respect."
  In Canberra, the Australan Journalists Association federal secretary,
Mr Neal Swancott, said the bid, coming a week after the Federal Government
announced new policies of cross-media ownership, was breathtaking in its
arrogance.           
  "It can be seen as a challenge to, and a defiance of, the Government,"
he said.
