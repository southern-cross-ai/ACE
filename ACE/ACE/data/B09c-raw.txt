	<h> Bearing in mind
Parents' pride goes before the fall ...</h>
	


	<bl> Dr Kenneth Isaacs</bl>
	

  Only upon the birth of one's own child can one know the full meaning of
the trite phrase, &quot;bundle of joy&quot;. Proud parents respond to the event of
birth with intense pleasure, and along with concern for immediate care,
start fantasising the child's future.
  Sometimes it is because a parent perceives a child as an extension of
self rather than as a separate being, that sense of competition with other
parents emerges, with vicarious parental participation in each step of progress
of the developing child.
  The desire for a super-child creeps into mother or father. That desire
can yield disaster. At minimum, the dangers lurking along the paths are
serious enough that it should make parents cautious when they find themselves
thinking in terms of super-child.
  Numerous plans are available to teach children to read at one year, 
be toilet trained at six months, play the piano as*a soon as they can sit,
and do maths at two years to support the glittering promise to have a college
graduate at 15 years of age.
  Some parents leap to the opportunity to enter their child in an infant
olympics. The tour de force of complex math capacity before the child can
deal well with words to describe the problems, toilet training before nerve
fibre has developed a myelin insulating sheath that can allow the child
to have clear messages anticipating the event, or listening to philosophic
treatises in which words are not understood, etc. can create lifelong problems.
