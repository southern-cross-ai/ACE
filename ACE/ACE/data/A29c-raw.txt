	<h> Boycott by 19 nations feared </h>
	


	<misc> LONDON, Sun: </misc>
	

  Organisers fear that as many as 19 of the 49 nations entered
in the Edinburgh Commonwealth Games could join the African-led boycott.
  Five countries have already said they will keep their athletes away from
the Games - due to start on July 24 - mainly in protest at the British
Government's refusal to impose trade sanctions on South Africa.
  Tanzania confirmed today that it would join the movement started by Nigeria
on Wednesday which was then followed by Ghana the same day, by Uganda
on Friday and by Kenya yesterday.
  The countries which have pulled out are also upset at the inclusion in
the English squad of two South African born women, runner Zola Budd and
swimmer Annette Cowley, both of whom use British passports. 
  Organisers believe the growing momentum of the boycott could cause it
to sweep through the other 10 African countries in the Commonwealth:
Botswana, Gambia, Lesotho, Malawi, Mauritius, Seychelles, Sierra Leone,
Swaziland, Zambia and Zimbabwe.
  Zimbabwe is waiting till next week's meeting of southern African nations
in the &quot;front line&quot; of the struggle against South Africa's apartheid system.
