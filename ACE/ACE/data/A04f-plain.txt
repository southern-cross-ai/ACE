Unique seafood platter  

A UNIQUE Aussie-Asian seafood platter is wowing 'em at Angela's Eastern Cafe 
in Eastlakes (near Kingsford).
  Angela's has already made its name for superb Singapore chilli crab (and 
crab done Malay sambal and Indian style).  Choose your own live crab!
  The $35-for-two platter has mud crab (with BBQ or other sauce), garlic 
prawns, prawn cutlets, fish, fresh calamari, mussels and pippies in black bean 
sauce, plus greens and fried rice.
  It's also ideal as an entree for four-six people.
  Angela's owner Harry Low (whose wife Kim is the marvellous cook) has also 
introduced a deluxe lobster Indian curry.
  It has fresh lobster tail, prawns, steak, greens and special fried rice.
  Coming up soon is Angela's Sydney Harbor cruise: Sun night, Aug 31 on MV 
Southern Cross and Matilda II.
  There'll be chilli and garlic crab, a huge carvery, open bar, Chinese lion 
dance and fireworks and live entertainment. 
  You could win a trip-for-two to Singapore.
  Cruise price is $54 pp.
  Book for it and for lunch (Thurs-Fri) and dinner (Tues-Sun) on 693 2038 or
