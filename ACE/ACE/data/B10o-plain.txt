Pope's tour is lacking in soul  

I COMMEND you for your timely and pertinent editorial (Oct. 15) regarding
the marketing of the Pope's visit to Australia. Letters to the press indicate
a ground-swell of rejection of this display, by catholic and non-catholic
members of church communities.
  Monsignor Walsh has manipulated the Press of this country to promote the
Pope as some kind of supernatural Santa Claus who likes everybody.
  The truth is the Pope is a highly political person who is at loggerheads
with many christians who espoused the spirit of Vatican 11.
