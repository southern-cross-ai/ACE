PM WINS HARE KRISHNA VOTE  

THE Hare Krishna cult has backed Prime Minister Bob Hawke's call to make
the unemployed work for the community.
  The shaven-headed chanters say they will take as many of the unemployed
as the CES can supply and will send them out to beautify Sydney.
  "Work is very instructive to the soul and is essential if these kids
aren't going to get hooked on drugs," said Krishna spokesman Tony Foley.
  "We do a lot of work in rehabilitating drug addicts.  They help us prepare
free meals for the poor and clean the streets," he said.
