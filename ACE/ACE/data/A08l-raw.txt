	<h> Bored Mulray will quit morning radio </h>
	

  CHEEKY morning radio announcer Doug Mulray has quit 2MMM - and he's planning
to join the ranks of the unemployed.
  Mulray will leave in five weeks when the current radio rating survey ends.
  Mulray said he is leaving &quot;because I'm tired of being a breakfast radio
announcer after seven years&quot;.
  &quot;I want a job where I get home at 4 o'clock in the morning instead of
having to get up at 4 o'clock in the morning,&quot; he said.
  Mulray says he is going on an extended holiday and when he returns he will
start looking for a new job.
