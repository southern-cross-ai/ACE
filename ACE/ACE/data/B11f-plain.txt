Red tape waste  

THE Government Business Regulation Review Unit - itself a bureaucratic mouthful
- has produced some horrifying figures on the cost of red tape.
  Australia, it is said, has a characteristic talent for bureaucracy. That
talent is costing us up to $80 billion a year. Of course, it is outlandish
and fanciful to suggest that all government regulations can be abolished.
But there is clearly vast potential for the red tape burden to be shed.
  According to the Confederation of Australian Industry, business regulation
is costing 20 cents in the dollar. That is far too expensive. It must
be trimmed quickly.
