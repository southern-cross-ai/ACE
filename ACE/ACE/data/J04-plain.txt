Reaction of 7,8-dimethoxy-1,4,5,9,13c,13d-hexahydro-2
H-indolo[3',2':4,5]indolo[1,7,6-aji]isoquinoline(4a) and
8,9-dimethoxy-1,2,3,5,6,10,14c,14d-octahydro-indolo[3',2':3,4]naphtho[2,1,8-ija]
quinolizine(4b) with cyanogen bromide in the presence of potassium carbonate
afforded the elimination products 7,8-dimethoxy-1,2,3,4,5,9-hexahydro[3]
benzazonino[8,7,6-abc]carbazole-3-carbonitrile (5a) and
8,9-dimethoxy-2,3,4,5,6,10-hexahydro-1 H-[3]benzazecino[9,8,7-abc]carbazole-
4-carbonitrile (5b) in 4% and 88% yield respectively;
7-(2-bromo)ethyl-1,2-dimethoxy-4,5,6,6a,7,12-hexahydroisoquino[8,1-ab]carbazole-
6-carbonitrile (6a) was also isolated in 20% yield from the former reaction.
Products of analogous structure were also obtained from (4a,b) when methyl
chloroformate was used in place of cyanogen bromide.  Reaction of (4b) with
cyanogen bromide in the presence of water and magnesium oxide afforded the
solvolysis product 14d-hydroxy-8,9-dimethoxy-2,3,4,5,6,10,14c,14d-octahydro-1
H-[3]benzazecino[9,8,7-abc]carbazole-4-carbonitrile (8b) together with (5b).
Similarly application of this reaction to 8,9-dimethoxy-2,3,5,6,11a,11b-
hexahydro-1 H-naphtho[2,1,8-ija]quinolizine (1b) afforded both the
corresponding solvolysis and elimination products; (4a) and
7,8-dimethoxy-1,2,4,5,10a,10b-hexahydronaphtho[1,8,7-ghi]indolizine (1a),
however, gave only solvolysis products.  Solvolysis and elimination products
were also isolated when (1b) and 4(b) were subjected to
cyanogen-bromide-mediated methanolysis reactions.  Acid-catalysed elimination
reactions of the alcohol solvolysis products are described along with reaction
of some of the elimination products with lithium tetrahydroaluminate.

  Central to recent interest in bridged-aromatic compounds (for recent review
see) has been the remarkable deformation induced  in the aromatic
ring by the addition of aliphatic bridges of suitably small lengths.  Also
of interest is the influence of nonplanarity of the aromatic moiety, and
of transannular interactions between the aromatic ring and the proximate
aliphatic bridge, on the physical and chemical properties of these compounds.
Recently we reported the synthesis of the aromatic-ring distorted 
1,7-bridged naphthalene derivatives (2a-e): crucial to our synthetic strategy 
was the cyanogen-bromide- and chloroformate-ester-mediated (cf.) rupture of the 
central carbon-nitrogen bond of (1a,b) (Scheme 1).  We now wish to report 
the application of this strategy to the synthesis of related indole-annelated 
derivatives, and to outline some further aspects of the key ring-destruction 
reactions and of the chemistry of some of the bridged heterocyclic derivatives.

 Results and Discussion  

  The indole-annelated substrates (4a,b) required for the ring-destruction
reactions were prepared in good yield from boron-trifluoride-mediated 
Fischer indolization reactions of the amino ketones (3a,b) (Scheme 2).
  Structural assignment of (4a) and (4b), which are derivatives of new
heterocyclic ring systems, was made on analytical and spectroscopic grounds.
In the infra-red spectra of (4a) and (4b) the appearance of an absorption
band at 3460 cm-1 and 3465 cm-1 respectively was consistent with the 
presence of an indolic NH group.  In the 1H n.m.r. spectra a one-proton 
singlet at     9.38 in (4a) and at    9.37 in (4b) was assigned 
to this secondary amino group in each case.  A one-proton doublet at 
   4.41 (J 8.1 Hz) in (4a) and at    4.39 (J 6.4 Hz) in (4b) were
assigned to H 13d and H 14d respectively.  In the proton off-resonance
decoupled carbon-13 n.m.r. spectra of these compounds the methine carbon
atoms of (4a), C 13d and C 13c, and of (4b), C 14d and C 14c, appeared as
doublets at 59.8, 34.9, 57.5 and 33.4 ppm respectively.
  Reaction of (4a) and (4b) with cyanogen bromide in ethanol-free chloroform,
in the presence of potassium carbonate, gave the hexahydro benzazonino
[8,7,6-abc]carbazole-3-carbonitrile (5a) and the hexahydro-1 H-bezazecino
[9,8,7-abc]carbazole-4-carbonitrile (5b) in 4% and 88% yield respectively
(Scheme 2).  The related urethanes (5c) and (5d) were also obtained in 14%
and 82% yield respectively when methyl chloroformate was used in place of
cyanogen bromide.
  Structural assignment of these compounds rests on spectroscopic evidence,
and also analytical evidence in the case of (5b) and (5d); the elemental
composition of compounds (5a) and (5c), which were obtained as unstable
gums, was established from high-resolution mass spectroscopy.  By way of
illustration, a detailed account of the structural assignment of (5a) and
(5b) only is presented.  In the infrared spectra of these compounds a
characteristically sharp band for the cyanamide group was present [at 
2200 cm-1 for (5a) and 2220 cm-1 for (5b)] together with bands [at 3420 
cm-1 for (5a) and 3390 cm-1 and 3310 cm-1 for (5b)] ascribable to the NH 
group.  In the 100-MHz H n.m.r. spectrum of (5a) a downfield singlet at 
   9.78 (1H) and two other singlets at    7.58 (1H) and 6.83 
(1H) were assigned to H9, H 13d and H6 respectively, while a doublet at 
   8.12 (J 8 Hz,1H) was assigned to H13; the chemical shift of this
latter proton was similar to that reported for H4 and H5 in carbazole. In 
the 300-MHz H n.m.r. spectrum of (5b) the corresponding protons H 10, H 14d,
H 7 and H 14 appeared at    10.00(singlet), 7.62(singlet), 7.03(singlet) 
and 8.13(doublet,J 8 Hz).  The remaining aromatic protons in (5b), H 11,H 12
and H 13, were assigned to signals at    7.67 (broad doublet, J 8 Hz),
7.46; (ddd, J 8,7,1 Hz) and 7.31 (ddd,J 8,7,1 Hz) respectively; the
corresponding protons H 10, H 11 and H 12 in (5a) appeared as an unresolved
multiplet between    7.70 and 7.05.
  In the case of the reaction of (4a) with cyanogen bromide and methyl
chloroformate the ring-opened derivatives (6a) and (6b) were also obtained
in 20% and 42% yield respectively.  The bromide (6a) was obtained as a gum
and decomposed rapidly on storage; however, this compound, together with
(6b), was adequately characterized.  Products of analogous structure to
(6a) and (6b) were also reported from the reaction of (1a) with cyanogen
bromide and methyl chloroformate.  Indeed the preparative usefulness of
these reactions of (1a) and (4a) is clearly limited by the formation of
halogen-containing side products.  Accordingly, attention was directed to
cyanogen bromide-mediated solvolysis reactions of (1a,b) and (4a,b)
with the aim of developing an alternative and more viable route to the
cyanamides (2a) and (5a).  A further incentive for exploring a solvolytic
route to (5a) was forthcoming from a comparison of the ultraviolet spectra
of (5c) and (5d); a significant red-shift, consistent with aromatic-ring
distortion, was observed in that of (5c), and it was therefore
of interest to attempt to obtain larger amounts of the related compound
(5a) for more detailed structural studies.
  Reaction of (1a,b) and (4a,b) with cyanogen bromide in the presence of
water, and also in the presence of methanol in the case of (1b) and (4b),
afforded the alcohols (7a,b) and (8a,b), and the ethers (7c) and (8c) (Schemes
2 and 3) (Table 1).  The carbonitriles (2b) and (5b) were also obtained
from the reactions of (1b) and (4b).
  Structural assignments for these solvolysis products were supported by
spectroscopic data, and molecular compositions were established by
high-resolution mass spectra. 
  The infrared spectra of all these compounds showed a strong absorption
band with frequency values ranging from 2200 to 2220 cm-1 for the
cyanamide group, while, additionally, those of (7a,b) and (8a,b) had a broad
band centred at 3420, 3440, 3290 and 3410 cm-1 respectively which
confirmed the incorporation of a hydroxy group.  Likewise in the H n.m.r.
spectra of (7c) and (8c) the presence of a three-proton singlet at δ
3.15 and    3.14 respectively confirmed the incorporation of an aliphatic
methoxy group; a downfield one-proton singlet at    4.58  and one-proton
doublet (J 3 Hz) at    4.88 respectively were assigned to the methine
proton attached to the carbon bearing the methoxy group.  In the H n.m.r.
spectra of the alcohols (7a,b) and (8a,b) the corresponding methine proton
appeared as a downfield one-proton signal at chemical shifts ranging from
   4.94 to 5.67.
  Acid-catalysed elimination of the hydroxy groups of (7b) and (8b) was
expected to be facile and, in the event, brief treatment of these compounds
with hydrochloric acid afforded the more highly aromatized derivatives (2b)
and (5b) in excellent yield.  On the other hand the alcohols (7a) and (8a)
were inert under identical reaction conditions; this reflects the increased
strain which must be accommodated in the conversion of C 8a and C 10c in
(7a) and C 13c and C 13d in (8a) from tetrahedral to trigonal geometry.
The elimination of water from these compounds was, however, effected by
reaction with p-toluenesulfonic acid in refluxing toluene.  The isomeric
4 H-naphth[1,8,7- and 1 H-naphth[1,8-de]
azocine-3-carbonitrile derivatives (2a) and (9) were obtained in 47% and
29% yield respectively from (7a) whereas the [3]benzazocino[7,6-a,b]carbazole-
6-carbonitrile (10) was obtained in 51% yield from (8a).
  In the H n.m.r. spectrum of (9) a downfield doublet of doublets at δ
8.17 (1H,J 8.6, 1.4 Hz) was assigned to H 9.  Two other signals with the
same multiplicities at    7.37 (1 H,J 8.6, 6.9 Hz) and at    7.16 
(1H, J 6.9, 1.4Hz) were assigned to H 10 and H 11 respectively.  A singlet at
   7.07 (1H) was ascribed to H 6. Significantly the ultraviolet absorption
spectrum of (9) showed a significant blue shift compared with that of (2b),
consistent with the reduction of naphthalene ring distortion in (9), expected
from an inspection of Dreiding molecular models of these molecules; it is
noteworthy that, apart from (9), the only other reported representative
of the naphth[1,8-de]azocine ring system is an amide prepared from the
photocyclization of 2-chloro-N-[2-(naphthalen-1-yl)]ethylacetamide. 
  In the 1H n.m.r. spectrum of the pentacyclic derivative (10) a broad singlet
downfield at    10.19 (1H) was ascribed to H 14.  Two other singlets at
   7.86 (1H) and 7.07 (1H) were assigned to H9 and H3 respectively, 
whereas doublets at    8.07 (1H, J 7.5 Hz) and 7.60 (1H, J 8.2 Hz) were 
assigned in turn to H 10 and H 13.  The remaining aromatic protons H 12 and 
H 11 appeared as multiplets.
  The mechanistic pathway for these elimination reactions of (7a,b) and
(8a,b) has not been rigorously delineated; however, it was shown in another
experiment that heating (2a) in refluxing toluene in the presence of
p-toluenesulfonic acid did not afford (9), although (2a) was slowly consumed.
The formation of (9) and (10) is consistent with the intermediacy of carbonium
ions derived from acid-promoted heterolysis of the benzylic carbon-oxygen
bond of (7a) and (8a); the reduction of strain energy which should follow
from a 1,2-alkyl shift would provide a strong driving force for the formation
of these rearranged products.
  Reaction of the cyanamide (5b) and of the urethane (5d) with lithium
tetrahydroaluminate was expected to afford the amine derivatives (5e) and
(5f) respectively; in the event only mixtures of intractable polar products
were formed.  Reaction of (2b) with lithium tetrahydroaluminate likewise
took an unexpected course, and the amine (11) was isolated in 86% yield
(Scheme 1); the structural assignment of (11) was confirmed from an alternative
synthesis by palladium-mediated oxidation of (1b).  Reduction of the urethane
(2d) with lithium tetrahydroaluminate afforded (2f) in 95% yield.  In the
1H n.m.r. spectrum and proton off-resonance decoupled C n.m.r. spectrum of
this compound a singlet at    2.46 (3H) and a quartet at 43.2 ppm
respectively confirmed the presence of the aminomethyl group.  The chemical
shifts of H 3, H 10 and H 11 in the 1H n.m.r. spectra of (2d) and (2f) were
very similar:    6.89 (s), 7.19 (dd,J 10, 2 Hz), 7.88 (d, J 10 Hz) 
compared with    6.89 (s), 7.24 (broad d, J 8.4 Hz), and 7.90 (d, J 8,4 
Hz).  However, H 11c was dramatically deshielded from    7.94 in (2d) to 
9.33 in (2f), presumably due to a transannular deshielding effect of the amino 
group; the fact that the nitrogen in the bridging chain may indeed be proximate
to H 11c is supported by the single-crystal X-ray data on the related urethane
derivative (2e).

 Experimental  

  Microanalyses were carried out by the Australian Microanalytical Service,
Melbourne, and by the Microanalytical Service of the Australian National
University, Canberra, on samples which had been dried in a vacuum over
phosphorus pentoxide, at a temperature of 65°, unless indicated 
otherwise.
  Melting points were determined on a Yanagimoto Seisakusho micro-melting
point apparatus and are uncorrected.
  Mass spectra were determined on a VG MM 7070F mass spectrometer operating
at 70 eV with a source temperature of 200° (direct insertion); peak
intensities (in brackets) are expressed as a percentage of the base peak.
  1H nuclear magnetic resonance spectra were recorded on a Jeol JNM-4H-100
(100 MHz), a Jeol FX-200 (200 MHz), a Bruker HX-270 (270 MHz), or a Bruker
CXP-300 (300 MHz) spectrometer, tetramethylsilane being the internal standard.
The 13C n.m.r. spectra were recorded on one of the last three
spectrometers; chemical shifts, in ppm, were measured relative to
tetramethylsilane, and the spectrometer used is implied by the frequency
noted for the corresponding proton spectra in each case.
