Here's how the drivers shape up for the grand Formula 1 race  

No. 1. ALAIN PROST, 31, France.  The little Frenchman finally brought the
world championship to France in 1985.  He is by far the most successful
driver of the current era, twice finishing as runner-up (1983-84) and with
22 Grand Prix wins under his belt.  Prost is the epitome of smoothness
and a master of racecraft, and it will come as no surprise to see him retain
his hard-won title this year.
No. 2. Keke Rosberg, 37, Finland.  The McLaren might seem a bit tame after
the mega horsepower he enjoyed last year, but Keke will undoubtedly give
it everything he's got.  They don't come any braver than last year's Australian
Grand Prix winner, and only time will tell if the Fin's brutal style will
suit his new mount.
No. 3. Martin Brundle, 26, England.  Tyrrell's new high profile could mean
young lion Brundle gets his big chance this year.  Injuries have punctuated
his Formula One career so far, but nobody doubts he has the talent to go
right to the top.
