Lagging law  

LAW reform can be a painfully slow process. But 28 years is an extraordinarily
long time to deny a group of Australian citizens the right of trial by jury.
  Though Christmas Island has been an Australian territory since 1958, its
criminal law is a hangover from the days of British colonialism.
  Even the death penalty still exists on the Christmas Island statute book
- though under overriding Austrlian law it can never be invoked.
  At the other extreme, the serious offence of drug trafficking carries
a maximum three-year gaol sentence - a legacy of a time when drugs were not
regarded as a deadly menace.
  The WA Law Society has rightly called for the island's laws - which are
similar to those applied in Singapore during the "Malayan Emergency" - to
be brought up to date.
  The legal anomaly does not seem to have caused practical problems till
now because the small island community has been free of serious crime.
But that is no excuse for allowing it to go unremedied for so many years.
