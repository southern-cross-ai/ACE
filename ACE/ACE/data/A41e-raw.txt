And now for something completely different.
  The restaurant came to us.
  As a veteran nosher around Adelaide, I have known Trevor and Cheryl Edwards
for years as providers of faultless front of house service.
  Steward Grant is a less familiar face, simply because he works behind
the scenes in the kitchen.
  They are now together as Raffles caterers.
  As they say, they handle functions from two to 200 people, business stuff
such as boardroom lunches and cocktail*cocktails parties, but also private social
stuff in way of lunch and dinner parties at home.
  They also provide a hamper picnic service for outdoor eating at $10
to $50 a head for parties of six or more.
  As the emergent and flourishing cottage industry of private caterers shows,
the advantages of this style of entertaining speak for themselves.
  Host and hostess get to sit down with the guests:  There is a BYO-like
factor too, in that using your own grog helps cover any extra costs.
  All the advantages of having expert, domestic staff on 1986 middle incomes.
  Just as Raffles is best known as that Singapore grand old hotel of empire,
with the Adelaide Raffles you briefly luxuriate back in that bygone era
of what the butler saw.
  Also, considering the service provided, they are not at all expensive.
  Prices vary, but range from $4 a head for cocktails parties, functions
from $10, and lunches and dinners from $18 a head.
  As you see from the prices adjusted as usual for two, our encounter with
the high life at home cost no more than many a restaurant meal.
  While we were being witty, debonair and sophisticated (i.e. drinking)
with the chums in the living room, the Raffles trio had arrived in professional
clobber, formal waiting and chef attire, and moved into the kitchen.
  And that was really that - in the sense that all we did from then on was
be summoned, be sat, eat, and eventually say farewell.
  And marvel at the way they had washed up and left the said kitchen spick
and span.
  They have printed menus, and a sampler of some 50 dishes would include
lemon mushrooms, beef yakitori, fillet steak with three pepper sauce, pork
with apple and calvados, chicken tarragon, lobster flambe, citrus mousse,
kahlua ice cream.
  At Mr Edwards' suggestion we had lunch of Australian salmon, smoked
loin of pork with lobster farcie and coup Mimi.
  This has been a very good year for delicious new fish tastes.
  The sea trout farmed fish pioneered by Safcol are now being seen on the
menus of top restaurants and, poached, are superb.
  The Australian salmon, from Tasmania and still very much a novelty, are
every bit as good, as delicate.
  Again, it was poached pink and succulent, and it was a great start to
life with Raffles.
  The unusual combination of smoked lamb with lobster was daring and
successful.
  The coup Mimi was a delicious confection made of avocado, strawberries
and cream.
  Also provided was fresh bread and coffee.
  They can draw on your resources but can also provide their own.
  Thanks to those earlier years of being pampered at table by Mr Edwards,
I had guessed we were in for a good time - and I was not disappointed.
  And how unfair life is.
  When in fullness of time the chums left, they were effusive in thanking
herself and myself.
