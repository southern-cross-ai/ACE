Deregulation: the tough get going  

In 1903, seventeen independent owners published twenty-one capital city
dailies. By 1982, the number of newspapers had dropped to seventeen, and

us all, as media-consumers, is critical. Liz Fell, a keen and critical watcher of
the Big Four's maneouvres, looks at some of the issues.
