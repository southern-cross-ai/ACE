Home building gets tonic $7.5m scheme will provide 150 houses in State initiative By Michael Gleeson  

A HOUSING construction initiative to cost $7,500,000 was yesterday launched
by the State Government to boost the State's ailing industry.
  The Minister for Housing, Mr John Beswick, said that in the next 12 months,
150 houses would be built under a new scheme sponsored by the Tasmanian
Development Authority.
  The homes will be offered to low-income first-home buyers, who will be
eligible for low-interest loans from the TDA, provided they are ineligible
for both bank and building society loans.
  Funds for the project come from State loan funds, some funds from the
Commonwealth/State Housing Agreement and revolving funds, including the
repayment of loans from people who have had previous loans with the TDA.
  Registered builders approved by the Tasmanian Development Authority will
receive interest-free TDA loans to buy suitable land.
  A ceiling price will apply to single blocks of land, with the loan secured
by a first-mortgage contract in favour of the TDA.
  Houses will be built to plans approved by an architect nominated by the
TDA, and will be financed progressively during construction.
  Finally, qualifying low-income earners will be advanced low-interest loans
and introduced to builders through real estate agents.
  Buyers are entitled to a maximum TDA loan of $55,000,with interest initially
at 10 per cent, rising to 12 per cent in the third year, after which an
interest review would take place.
  There will also be a price limit of $60,000, including the cost of the
land.
  According to Mr Beswick, the scheme will employ 66 men for one year, with
the multiplier effect employing an additional 162.
  Each successful tendering builder will be expected to construct 15 homes.
  According to Mr Beswick, homes not bought within two months of completion
will be purchased by the Housing Department or the TDA.
  Mr Beswick said it was not an initiative provided for in tomorrow's Budget.
  It was "an internal allocation of funds by the TDA, funds which are generally
available for this purpose".
  "The authority, in consultation with myself as Minister for Housing,
has seen fit to earmark $7,500,000 for this scheme as a means of stimulating
the homebuilding industry," Mr Beswick said.
  The scheme, known as HOBIS or the Home Ownership Building Industry Scheme,
joins the Housing Department's home-purchase scheme as the State's two
major housing initiatives.
  "That one (the Housing Department scheme) is designed to help people
buy houses, rather than to build new houses like this one," Mr Beswick said.
  He said there would be no scaling-down of the Housing Department's programme
in the Budget to make way for this scheme.
  The TDA has identified some 200 for HOBIS homes.
