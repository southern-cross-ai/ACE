INQUEST TOLD UNSAFE LOAD CRUSHED DRIVER  

  A truck driver neglected safe loading and unloading procedures and his
load crushed him to death.
  Two experts said this today at an inquest into the death of Michael St
John Kennedy, of Floreat.
  A Factory and Shops inspector, Mr Graeme Hearn, said that failure of the
firm, James Hardie and Co, to ensure safe loading had also contributed to
the accident on March 13.
  A Department of Occupational Health inspector, Mr Francis Keough, said
he thought Mr Kennedy's 10-year familiarity with handling cement pipes for
the company may have been a contributing factor.
  Unloading ramps had not been pulled out according to James Hardie procedure.  
  Mr Hearn said Mr Kennedy was a contract driver responsible for his own
loading.
