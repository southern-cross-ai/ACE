THE title is curiously flat - it conveys nothing in particular - and somehow
this is true of the film.  Directed by Roland Joffe from a screenplay by
Robert Bolt, The Mission is sumptuous, impressive, intelligent, full of
a sombre spiritual idealism; and no doubt it cost a fortune to make.  But
in the end I found it unsatisfying.
  The obvious comparison is with those big historical epics that David Lean
used to make (with Robert Bolt's collaboration) in the 1960s, and indeed
there are moments in The Mission when Robert De Niro - robed, bearded,
Messiah-like - seems eerily reminiscent of Lawrence of Arabia. But I was even 
more strongly reminded of Peter Shaffer's play, the Royal
Hunt of the Sun - there's a title to fire the imagination - which was made
into a sadly unsatisfactory film in 1969.
  It dealt with events in South America a couple of centuries before those
depicted here, but its central concerns - the power of faith, the conflict
between Western colonialism and native innocence - were much the same.
 And so too were its faults; sluggishness, pretentiousness, obscurity.
  The Mission is one of those films which proclaim themselves at the start
to be a &quot;true story&quot;, and as usual the assurance is disconcerting.  Are
we meant to be more indulgent towards the film because the events actually
happened?  Or did they?   There is always something funny about the
reconstruction of historical dialogue.  
  Opening the paperback &quot;novelisation&quot; of Bolt's screenplay, I chanced on
the following: &quot; `The boat is yours,' Cesar went on, with a wave of his
cigarillo.&quot;  Even if it were certain that the characters in The Mission
actually existed and that one of them had waved his cigarillo, I am the
sort of person who is immediately and irrationally prejudiced against taking
such things too seriously.
  The background to the film is, of course, authentic - and fascinating. It
is concerned with the political and ecclesiastical intrigues within the
European church in the mid 18th century, when the Jesuits were consolidating
their power.
  They were the New Right of their time - sinister and idealistic, fired
by holy zeal and the purity of their cause, distrusted by the secular powers
and mainstream politicians.  The beautiful missions which they built in
South America, in what are now parts of Brazil, Paraguay and Argentina,
were symbolic of their political might at home.
  In 1750 the Spanish and Portuguese kingdoms, anxious to curb Jesuit
influence, squabbled over the ownership of the mission territories, and
the Papacy intervened to resolve the dispute.  The Guarani Indians who
inhabited these dense jungles and verdant plains were being simultaneously
bartered by European slave traders, plundered by Portuguese colonists and
recruited to Christ's church by Spanish missionaries.
  The central figures in The Mission are Europeans - Robert De Niro as
Mendoza, a slave trader and mercenary, and Jeremy Irons, as the Jesuit Father
Gabriel, and the film is mainly about their friendship.
  But the true heroes are the Indians.  Enlightened opinion today would
insist that no one - missionaries included - had any right to intrude
on their territory, though Joffe's film portrays the Jesuits as true defenders
of their culture as well as bringers of spiritual grace.
  By the standards of the time perhaps they were.  Even the scheming papal
emissary, Altamirano (Ray McAnally), reflects at one point that the Indians
might have been better off left alone, and I would have to agree with him.
