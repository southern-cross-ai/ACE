Ed J R Davidson AN EMPIRICAL METHOD OF ASSESSING ROCK MASS BLASTABILITY By PETER A LILLY ABSTRACT  

  A method of assessing the blastability of a rock mass is presented which
makes use of five, readily available, simple parameters. These are the Rock
Mass Description, Joint Place Spacing, Joint Plane Orientation, Specific
Gravity Influence and Hardness. For a particular rock mass a value is assigned
to each parameter and the Blastability Index is calculated from these values.
Application of the Index in blast planning and computer modelling is discussed.

     INTRODUCTION  

  Achieving the optimum blast design for a particular rock mass type, be
it in mining or quarrying, can be an expensive and time-consuming procedure.
In particular obtaining a good first-estimate or starting point for the
quantity of explosive required to break the ground (ie. powder factor) can
be problematical. Estimates are usually based on the operator's experience
and/or the experience of a hired consultant.

  The method presented here provides the practical blasting engineer with
a good estimate of a rock masses' blastability based on observing a few
easily obtained geotechnical parameters. The method has been used by the
author in blast planning for operations of all sizes and scales and it has
proved invaluable on more than one occasion.

      GEOTECHNICAL FACTORS AFFECTING BLAST PERFORMANCE  

  Practically every parameter used to describe a rock mass will, theoretically,
have some effect on that rock mass' response to an explosive charge placed
with it. A significant amount of literature and research has been devoted
to this subject and some of these parameters include the static and dynamic
Young's modulus, Poisson's Ratio, density, compressional wave velocity,
tensile strength, compressive strength, Hugoniot elastic limit, stress wave
attenuation characteristics and porosity, as well as the frequency of
occurrence of bedding planes and the number, frequency and characteristics
of geological joints and faults (eg. Ash, 1973; Harries, 1978, 1981; Hagan,
1979, 1980; Cohen, 1980; Mercer 1980). From the viewpoint of a theoretician
wishing to model accurately the fragmentation and heave process, most of
the parameters must be considered.

  From the practical engineering viewpoint, however, it is comforting to
know that the rock mass parameters which contribute SIGNIFICANTLY to blasting
performance are relatively few. In the writer's experience these are as
follows.
  
  1. the structural nature of the rock mass, eg. blocky or massive or powdery,

  2. the spacing and orientation of planes of weakness such as joints, faults,
     bedding planes, schistocity and foliation,

  3. the specific gravity of the material,

  4. the hardness of the material.
  
  The meaning and significance of each of these will be discussed in turn.

 STRUCTURAL NATURE OF THE ROCK MASS  

  When an experienced blaster observes a rock mass with a view to fragmenting
it with explosives, the first thing he will note is "how it looks". If the
rock is blocky, that is made up of a multitude of joint-bounded blocks,
then he knows that the fragmentation will be controlled by these joints
more so than by the explosive- generated strain wave. If the rock is massive
or almost devoid of planes of weakness, then the fragment size distribution
will be almost entirely dependent on the generation and intersection of
blast-induced fractures. This initial, qualitative assessment of the rock
mass is extremely important. 

 JOINT PLANE SPACING  

  For the purposes of this discussion, joint planes will refer to all planes
of weakness in the rock, be they bedding planes, planes of foliation or
schistocity, fault planes or, indeed, geological or mining-induced joints
themselves.

  In jointed rock masses, where fragment size and shape is dependent largely
on the joints themselves, the spacing of existing planes of weakness will
give the engineer a good idea of the size and shape of the fragments which
he will find in the muck pile after a blast. Rock masses containing closely
spaced joint sets will (all other things being equal) require far lower
energy factors than those where joint spacing is measured in metres.

 JOINT PLANE ORIENTATION  

  The orientation of the predominant planes of weakness relative to the
free face is of critical importance, not only as regards fragment size
distribution but also muck pile diggability, bench floor profile and "toe"
(eg. Singh and Sarma, 1983). Clearly horizontal planes of weakness in a
horizontal bench operation are a far easier proposition to blast than, say,
planes which are dipping in the direction of throw. Not only can the latter
relationship produce slabby muck, it can also yield a saw-toothed bench
floor profile. Once again this parameter can be quickly and easily assessed
by the engineer.

 SPECIFIC GRAVITY AND HARDNESS  

  Although still influential, these two parameters are much less important
than the preceding three. The mass of rock per unit volume is significant
since, in general, heavier rock masses require more explosive energy to
break and move than do lighter rocks. Likewise, harder rocks can be more
difficult to breaK than softer rocks, although explosive properties do have
a major influence on this.

      THE BLASTABILITY INDEX (BI)  

  In some problems in rock engineering, the interaction between the many
rock-mass-related variables is so complex that analytical solutions are
not possible. In such situations it is common to use empirical rock mass
classifications, such as those developed at the South African CSIR (Bieniawski,
1973, 1976) and the Norwegian Geotechnical Institute (Barton, et al, 1974).
The rock quality indices obtained from these classifications allow the engineer
to make semi-quantitative estimates of stand-up time, span and support
requirements for underground openings, and slope angle for open pits.

  This concept has been extended to include rock mass blastability. The
parameters described in the foregoing sections have been combined in such
a way that, by ascribing certain guidelines, a total value can be obtained.
This total is then a measure of the overall blastability of the rock mass
or the ease with which it can be fragmented with explosive energy.

  The parameters with their weighting factors are shown in Table 1. It will
be noted that the index is heavily weighted towards the nature and orientation
of planes of weakness in the rock mass. The Blastability Index (BI) is obtained
by summing the five values described and dividing by two, ie.,

  .
 Table 1 APPLICATION OF THE INDEX USE IN SPECIFIC CHARGE DETERMINATIONS  

  The index was initially developed to cover all the rock mass types present
in the iron ore mines of north west Western Australia. As it is defined
for these mines, therefore, the index has a maximum value of 100. This
value refers to the extremely hard, iron-rich cap rock, massive in nature
and having a specific gravity of about 4 tonnes per cubic metre. At the
bottom end of the scale in these mines are soft friable shales which have
indices around 20.

  Historical blast data were used to construct the graph shown in Figure
1, which shows powder factor plotted against blastability index. It is
important to note that this diagram is valid for large-scale, rope shovel
operations having sizeable crushers and using ANFO as the primary explosive.
Figure 1 also shows energy factor (rather than powder factor) as the
alternative dependent variable so that explosives other than ANFO can be
compared.

  

 Figure 1: Blastability Index Versus powder/energy factor  
In smaller scale operations in which front-end loader equipment is being
used, powder/energy factors other than those shown will be required to achieve
the appropriate fragmentation and muck pile shape. Higher powder factors will
not be necessary, however, if RMD <20, BPS<15 and joint planes are favourably
oriented. Whatever the case, the BI can very quickly be used to construct
curves similar to that shown in Figure 1 specific to a particular scale of
operation.

 EXAMPLES  

  1.  Consider a highly laminated, soft, ferriginous shale which has horizontal
      to sub-horizontal bedding
        .

  2.  Consider a well-jointed, blocky quartzite in which the bedding planes
      strike roughly normal to the bench face
        .

 USE IN FRAGMENTATION MODELLING  

  Cunningham (1983) has developed a simple but extremely useful fragmentation
model based on the Kuznetsov equation and the Rosin-Ramler distribution.
Input for this model includes charge length, charge density, charge diameter,
burden, spacing, bench height and explosive relative weight strength. The
effect of rock type is included as a "rock factor". Experience with this
model in a wide variety of situations in Australia has shown that the rock
factor can be obtained from the BI by simply multiplying the BI by 0.12.

  Other models requiring similar rock type input can be calibrated to the
BI in a similar way.

      CONCLUSIONS  

  The Blastability Index incorporates easily recognisable and recordable
rock mass parameters which are significant in affecting blast performance
and muck pile diggability. Since the information required can be obtained
from exploration drilling or from existing bench faces, it can be used in
both the planning and production phases of projects requiring rock blasting.

  If an engineer knows the limitations of the loading and crushing equipment
he has at his disposal, he can readily obtain a graphical relationship between
energy/powder factor and the blastability index and thereby quantify blast
design input more effectively.

  When coupled with computerised fragmentation models, the blastability
index can provide an excellent means to experiment on the VDU screen with
a variety of blast designs, thereby avoiding expensive mistakes or
miscalculations in the field.

  The Index, as with all geomechanics classifications, has its weaknesses,
however. Because the Index is a simplification, situations will exist where
the BI does not in fact give a good estimate of blastability. This is
particularly true in extreme rock masses where one parameter may be dominant.
The BI does not differentiate between fragmentation and heave either and,
if anything, is biased toward fragmentation assessment.

  Future work on the index aims at incorporating the concept into the blast
simulation package being developed at the Julius Kruttschnitt Mineral Research
Centre (JKMRC). It is also planned to take explosives properties into account
since these strongly affect blast performance.
