Fence-sitting Commission  

  THE decision by the Arbitration Commission to award the 2.3 percent pay
increase is unfortunate, but it was to be expected. It has not demonstrated
a significant propensity to accept arguments based on economic logic alone.
If it had, it might well have rejected outright this increase or at least
postponed it.
  Its decision to reject the claim by the Australian Council of Trade Unions
for a 3 percent productivity-based increase is to be welcomed, but it might
have gone further. It might have found that the claim was spurious and
lacking economic logic.
  Certainly, on the basis of argument put to the Commission by employers,
that finding was open. Instead, it chose to hand the question back to unions
and employers. That might well prove to be a mistake.
  Two issues are in question. The first, and less contentious, is the matter
of extended superannuation entitlements to cover workers not already members
of schemes. On the whole, that issue is less difficult to accept.
Superannuation is both socially and economically desirable, particularly
is it helps relieve the burden on the public purse.
  The second, much more contentious issue, is the question of funding the
proposed wider superannuation coverage. That proposal relied upon an agreement
reached in secret between the Government and the trade unions, essentially as a
trade-off for accepting discounted wage increases.
