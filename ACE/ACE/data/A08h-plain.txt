A BIT OF A JOLT FOR JOGGERS  

MEN who take up marathon running to improve their health may find the exercise
denting their masculine pride.
  Researchers in America have discovered that too much running can cause
a man's testes to shrink.
  A study of six men who had run at least 125 kilometres a week for the
past five years, and could finish a marathon in less than two hours and
45 minutes, has come up with the shattering news.
  Susan MacConnie, of the University of Michigan, said none of the men reported
any sexual problems - but all had hormonal abnormalities which might eventually
cause the shrinking.
  They were deficient in a key hormone which sparks off activity in the testes
and eventually, reproductive hormones.
