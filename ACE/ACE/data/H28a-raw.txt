	<h> Travelling through Africa </h>
	

     1985 was truly an international year for the Australian Red
Cross Secretary General, Mr Leon Stubbings, as he explained to
New South Wales staff during a visit to the Division last
December.
     Mr Stubbings had visited a number of Societies in Africa
last year, as part of his campaign to become League President.
Although he was unsuccessful at the election, his visit to
sister societies, including Sudan, Libya, Mali*mali and
Mauritania was successful .
     &quot;Mauritania was a hot, rugged country, with its Red
Crescent Society working with the League to take care of many
thousands of drought victims*vicims,&quot; Mr Stubbings said.
     &quot;And to my fascination, Australian eucalyptus trees were
planted a mile out of Mauritania's capital city. The trees had
been planted as part of an attempt to stop the movement of the
sand dunes.
     &quot;I also found this in several other African countries,
including Zimbabwe, Sudan, and Kenya.
     &quot;The Australian eucalypts grow more quickly than normal
trees, hold sand, and are a quick growing fuel for cooking
purposes.&quot;
     Mr Stubbings said he would be approaching the Australian
Government on a project for sending gum trees to Africa.
     In Sudan, he visited a refugee camp about 35 miles from
the Eritrean Border.
     &quot;The houses they're living in are terribly primitive, but
most of these people are nomads, and the housing they would
build for themselves &quot;normally&quot; would have been similar.
However, the health of these refugees is much better than in
the Ethiopian camps two or three years ago,&quot; he said.
     &quot;The Sudan has a population of approximately 20 million
people, in an area the size of Western Australia. There are
more than 100 languages spoken in this country.&quot;
     In 1956, civil war erupted in Sudan between the Arab North
and the African South, which lasted for 17 years, in which time
ties with the west were broken.
     In 1976, Sudan improved relations with the west, and at
the same time, the League entered the country.
     The economy is based largely on agriculture, but only 20%
of the country is arable, and not all of this is being
cultivated. It is little wonder that droughts, often lasting
10 years in regions, have helped to cripple the country.
     At present, there are 80 delegates in the Sudan, being
supported by the Red Crescent Branch.
     Food is distributed throughout the country by airbridge,
and by the use of camels.
     For 1986, over $AUS 19,152,500 (22,983,000 sf) is needed
for protection and tracing activities, dissemination of
information, medical supplies and relief, programme support and
administration, aid to the national society. The major area
of spending is relief. This is food and goods to civilian
victims of conflict and drought, as well as seed and tools.
     &quot;I also visited Zimbabwe with Red Cross workers,
travelling on roads `where trucks don't go'.
     &quot;In Zimbabwe, there are about 300 volunteers in the
outback rural areas, helping handicapped people.
     &quot;In one small town, there was a young boy of ten or so,
who was born with cerebral palsy. The village people did not
know what to do with him, and his often `crazed' behaviour led
them to tie him to a tree every day to control him.
     &quot;The Zimbabwe Red Cross, which looks out for handicapped
children, were able to help the boy.&quot;
     Every week, a Red Cross volunteer nurse walks to the boy's
village, from her own, to check on the boy and his aged
grandmother who is now caring for him.
     &quot;Apart from the extraordinary work being done in those
countries, what impressed me most was how the ICRC, The League
and the National Societies worked together as the one Red
Cross.&quot;
