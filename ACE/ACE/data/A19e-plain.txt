Skiers face an uphill cost battle  

AS snow begins to fall, Victorians need to look at their bank accounts closely
before considering weekends at the ski resorts.
  This year will not be cheap for ski enthusiasts.
  A day ticket at Mt Buller costs $28 for adults, a rise of $2 from last
season, and $14 for children.
  Mt Hotham is charging $27 for adults and $11 for children, while Falls
Creek day tickets cost $28 and $14 and those at Mt Buffalo are $13.50 and
$7.
  A day's skiing at Mr Buller will cost about $90 - that is based on the
approximate expense of a ski ticket, an $8 parking fee, about $15 for petrol,
$7 for lunch, an average of $12 to hire skis, boots and poles and $20 deposit
on the hire gear.
  It is possible to minimise expenses by sharing petrol and parking costs
and taking your own lunch.
  If you are thinking of a weekend at a resort, consider the cost of
accommodation, eating out, as a lot of lodges do not provide food, and two
days' skiing  and ski hire.
  The Alpine Resorts Commission has set up a permanent booking office at
Mt Buller.
  The commission's agent on the mountain, Ms Merryn Wildschut, said bookings
were taken for all commercial lodges and flats and for about eight smaller,
private lodges.
  "The top price on our books for a bed for one night is $80 to $85, without
breakfast," she said.
  "The price is a little less during the week, at $81, and for bed and
breakfast accommodation the cost is $189 a weekend.
  "The private lodges range from $22 to $24 a night for bed only, to $102
for dinner, bed and breakfast."
  It is advisable to book early in the week, rather than arriving on the
mountain and trying to get a bed.
  Travelling to the mountain by bus, which saves a lot of hassles, costs
$47 return from Melbourne with Mansfield-Mt Buller Bus Lines.
  The cost of ski gear has risen about 15 to 20 per cent on last year.
  This is largely due to the fall of Australian dollar, according to Auski's
clothing manageress, Ms Vicki Furniss.
  "Normally, you could expect a rise of between 5 and 10 per cent," she
said.
  Skis will cost from $195 to $499 without bindings, depending on the quality
and brand.  Bindings are priced between $120 and $240 for racing, while
boots range from $150 to $370.
  If you are looking to buy ski clothing, expect to pay about $165 for
a shower and snow proof ski suit, or $135 to $300 for stretch pants or
coveralls.
  A parka costs $200 to $420 for the fully waterproofed variety, while gloves
are priced from $30 to $50 in leather and $50 to $100 for Gore-tex.
   If buying is too expensive, skiers should consider hiring equipment.
 The average daily hire cost for skis, boots, poles and clothing is about
$25 to $30, compared with about $450 to buy for a beginner skier.
  Ms Furniss said enthusiasts wanting to hire skis could do so in Melbourne.
  "You order your skis here and pick them up on the mountain.  It saves
the hassle of carrying them up the mountain and trying to rent skis on a
busy weekend.
