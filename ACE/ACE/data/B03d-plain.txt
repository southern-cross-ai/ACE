WHY THE SWANS WILL BE CROWING 

WITH much fanfare and Hollywood razzamataz the Sydney Swans yesterday made
ugly ducklings of the NSW Rugby League.
  The Swans' stunning victory over Carlton - maintaining their outright
lead on the VFL premiership table - was watched by 37,873 fans at the SCG.
  Yet five rugby league fixtures around Sydney yesterday managed a total
attendance of only 40,743, with the Penrith-St George match drawing the
top crowd of 11,357.
  It would be easy to dismiss the alarming discrepancy between these figures:
  The Swans do have a certain novelty value, not least because the former
South Melbourne Club, the disgrace of the VFL, have won six successive games
this season.
  Dr Geoffrey Edelsten, controversial Sydney medical entrepreneur and
part-owner of the Swans, with his beautiful young wife Leanne, have focused
much attention on this hitherto "foreign" football code.

Value for money
  Quite apart from the Swans' stupendous form, the Hollywood pizazz and
the cheerleaders - corny as it all may be - show the club is really trying
to give the crowds value for money.
  And it worked. Only 20 minutes into the first quarter yesterday, the gates
were shut as thousands of fans still flocked to get in.
  Admittedly, rugby league is too thoroughly entrenched in Sydney to be
knocked from its roost.
  But RL officials would be short-sighted indeed not to take notice of
yesterday's crowds.
  Attendances have indeed been picking up these past couple of seasons after
a concerted effort by League officials. 
  But that the Swans are making big inroads can't be ignored.
