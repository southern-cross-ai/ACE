Kaye Garrett is late again.  She has rushed into the cabin in her bikini
and thrown her wet towel on my bunk.
  `Have I got time for a ciggie?' she asks, lighting up anyway though she
knows we are First Sitting.  Then she gets down to work.  She circles her
eyes with a sort of white lipstick and dots biscuit-coloured lotion onto
the compass points of her face.  I take this opportunity to slip her towel
onto the floor.  
  `I don't know why you go to all this trouble', Bar Holland calls down
from the top bunk.  `The people on this ship are only interested in food
and sexual intercourse.'
  `Oh?' says Kaye Garrett.  `Why do you say that?'  Her eyes are open very
wide in the mirror but she's not looking at us.  With a little black brush
she is grooming the wing of her lashes.  Does she know that as she does
this her mouth springs open like a fish?
  `Observation',  Bar Holland says.  I hear her yawning.  `I haven't put
it to the test.'
  The dinner chimes crackle over the P.A.  Doors slam up and down the corridor
and a great wave of people calling out and jingling keys seems to rush past
our cabin.  I stand up.  I have been ready for ages.
  Kaye rips off her bikini and reaches into the wardrobe.  `Oh Hull.'  She's
turning to me, she's holding my pink shirt, `Oh Hully, would you mind,
could I please...?'
  I take a breath.  I've practised this.  I was going to say, in a light,
pleasant voice, `Actually Kaye, I'd thought of wearing that myself tomorrow'.
But when she stands in front of me like this, naked, watching me, as if
she's testing me, I don't know where to look ...
  There is a quick knock and the door swings open.  Kaye screams and clutches
my shirt to her.
  `Sorry ladeez, so sorry ladeez.'  It is Taki, our cabin steward, with
an armful of towels.  He backs out, groping to close the door behind him.
  `Bloody Taki', Kaye says.  She's buttoning up my shirt.
  `Hot Greek blood', calls down Bar.
  `He must have thought we'd gone to dinner', I say.  `We are late.'  In
the mornings I find him waiting outside the door with his mop and duster.
I say, `I'm sorry.  The other girls are still slee-ping.'  I put my head
on my hands to mime a pillow.  He nods and smiles.  He understands.
  `Oh yeah?' says Kaye.  `He's always barging in.'  She's pulling on a black
skirt, tucking in my shirt.  The pink shirt is part of an ensemble my mother
and I bought after my last day at school.  `For deck games', my mother said.
Sometimes I think about the Trip as my mother planned it.  It is like another
ship travelling alongside this one, with all its passengers on deck waving
in a friendly sort of way.  There are bound to be some awfully nice types
amongst them, my parents had a ball on their Trip Out, they are waving
but getting hard to see now, the animal throb and grind of this ship is
leaving them behind.
  
The lights flicker in the narrow corridors.  We stagger a little as the
ship sways.  Voices are rising in the bars, `Aloha' and `Chelsea', where
the early drinkers have settled in.  As our heels clatter up the stairs
two stewards hiss from a doorway: `Psst!  I love you!'  We look straight
ahead but we giggle.  Don't they know that with us their case is hopeless?
  We part at the doors of the dining-room.  Kaye Garrett sort of glides
in past us, gone for the night.
  `I'll meet you here afterwards', I say to Bar Holland.  If I don't say
this she is quite likely to wander off in her absent-minded way, and then
I am alone for the whole evening.  `Here, okay?'
  `Okay', she says.  She brings her book with her.  She sits at a table
with a big family.  Quite often they are sea-sick and only the father is
there.  He is glad of a bit of peace and quiet, Bar says.  He's quite happy
if she reads between courses.
  My table is for four, on the far side of the dining-room.  I take my usual
seat, next to the German man.  I say Good Evening to him, I have never caught
his name.  He wears a white suit to dinner and has a short white beard.
He's about my father's age:  it is his eleventh sea voyage.  This is all
I know about him.
  `We thought you were going to miss out on the soup', Marie says from across
the table.  She is a secretary from Wollongong.  `Still not to worry, we've
only just got ours as usual.'  Marie is frustrated by the service on this
ship, especially at the table.  `It's the same old story', she told me,
`the quiet ones get overlooked'.
  `Hi', says Eric, who sits next to her.
  `Try and catch the waiter's eye', Marie advises me, `when he goes to that
big table'.
  But I don't want any soup.  I am trying to think of something to say to
Eric.
  `How did you go at deck-tennis this afternoon?'
  He laughs.  `I got a thrashing.  I'm out of the tournament.  I think I'm
going to have to invent deck-cricket.  Maybe I'd make a better fist of that.'
  I laugh, understandingly.  I know that Eric plays cricket in summer, swims
all year round, likes early Blues and opera, grew up on a farm in northern
New South Wales, has just finished his second year of Law.  I know because
over two weeks' meals I have asked him.  The trouble is, I'm running out
of questions.  He asks me questions too sometimes, often the same questions.
I've told him three times now that I've just done my matric, that I'm going
to stay with relatives in England.
  `Get a load of that would you', Marie says.  `That big table.  On to the
main course already and we haven't even ordered the entree!'
  `I met another girl from Perth today', Eric says to me.  His nose is
sunburnt, a big nose, he isn't really good-looking.  But the first time
he came to our table and smiled and pulled Marie's chair out for her, I
thought: He's nice. `A blonde girl, Barbara.'
  `Oh, Bar Holland.  She went to school with me.  She shares my cabin.'
  `She seems like quite an original.'
  `Yes.  Well I didn't really get to know her before this trip.  We were
in different classes ...'
  `You can't have any secrets when you share a cabin, I can tell you', Marie
says.
  `Do you share a cabin?'  I ask the German man after a while.  It seems
so terribly rude not to say anything to him for the whole meal.
  `I am alone', the German man replies.  `I prefer.'
  `I think I would too.'  I give a little laugh.  `Not that I've got any
secrets.'
  `Ah', says the German man.  `Without secrets nothing is possible.'
  `What is your cabin number by the way?' Eric asks me.
  

  `There she is', I say to Bar Holland.  We are taking our after-dinner
stroll around A Deck.
  `Who?'
  `Kaye.  It looks like it's Officers' Night tonight.'
  `Chelsea' is dimly lit, but the pink shirt, the white uniforms around
it, glow in the light from behind the bar.
  `I suppose it's a good way to learn Greek', I say, climbing up the ladder
onto Boat Deck behind Bar Holland.  There is a railing at the front of Boat
Deck, past the funnels, where we always stand.  It is as high and far as
you can go.
  I want to talk about Kaye Garrett with Bar, but something holds me back.
`All that make-up', I want to say, `do you think she looks hard?  Do you
think she looks older than seventeen?  I think swearing is unfeminine. 
Does she swear in front of men?  What is sex-appeal anyway?  She's got lots
of nice clothes herself, I don't know why she ...'
  It is quieter up here, we are further away from the engine, you can even
hear the crisp breaking of the wake, white in the black sea.  The wind blows
back Bar Holland's beach-white hair from her long, stern, chin.  Her eyelashes
are white too, so that her stare beyond the ship seems unblinking.  I wish
that I was like Bar Holland, my mind on higher things.
  `Think I'll go down and read', she says.
  `Yes', I say, `I must finish my letter'.
  Music has started up in the ballroom.  The soft thud of the drum, the
even ripple of the piano.  `Leesten', the singer's voice crackles as he
adjusts the microphone, `do you want to know a see-gret?'
  Corridor by corridor we descend the ship.
  We went to the ballroom once, on our first night aboard.  Kaye was with
us then.  We sat at a table by the dance-floor and ordered drinks.  `To
us', Kaye said.  The band, in midnight-blue tuxedos, winked and bowed at
us.  There was a solo on the electric guitar, the theme song from `Bonanza'.
A middle-aged couple danced a professional tango under the swirling gold
hexagons of the dome in the middle of the ceiling.  
  `Oh my God', Kaye Garrett said, `This is dire.'
  But after a while the ballroom filled with people, Second Sitting people.
The band took off their coats.  The dance floor thronged, lights dimmed,
shadows raced around the walls.  A white uniform bowed before Kaye.  She
got up slowly, her face was severe over his shoulder as they circled the
floor.  Bar Holland and I sipped our drinks, islanded amongst empty tables
and chairs.  Bar Holland stood up.
  `I'm going', she said.  `I'm bored.'
  We made a great show of fanning ourselves on the deck, of gasping for
fresh air.

`Who do you write all these letters to?' Bar Holland's bunk creaks above
me as she changes position, sighs, flicks pages.  I look at my watch.  9.30.
We have made our descent too early.  But there's no going back.  That would
be against our code, our anti-ship stance.  And I've already rollered up
my hair.
  `Oh - my parents mainly', I say.
  `S'pose I ought to drop the folks a line', says Bar.  `But what do you
say?  "I am eating, sleeping and reading.  Fondest regards".'
  `I'm sure they'd like to know how you are.'
  The bunk thumps.  Bar Holland's legs wave past me.  She crouch-lands on
the floor.  `They know I'm alive', she says.  `The rest is just - role play.'
  `But your parents - well, they feel for you', I say from the shadows of
my bunk.
  `Do they?'  She is walking up and down the cabin breast-stroking the air.
`How do you know what you feel if you just keep on spouting off your lines?'
Her voice trails off, she yawns.  `Anyway', she mutters, `I don't seem to
go in for feelings'.
  There's a knock at the door.  I shrink back clutching my rollers.  Bar
Holland opens it an inch.  Her blouse at the back is hanging out of her
skirt.  Her hair is fizzed into a little crown from lying down.
  `Oh it's you', she says.  She sounds almost angry.  `Oh all right, why
not.'  She reaches for her key on the dressing table.
  It's Eric.
 

You should see me now, I write, lying back next to the swimming pool!  I
pause.  This is more or less the case.  It was a relief to see this empty
deckchair as I picked my way through all those brown oily bodies.  `Yes
dear, come and join me', the old lady in the next chair said.  She's asleep
now.  We're not all that far from the pool.  The weather is perfect, everybody
is here.  I waved to Kaye Garrett but she didn't see me.  She's amongst
a very lively crowd of people.  Marie waves though, from under her big sunhat,
while another girl rubs cream into her shoulders.
