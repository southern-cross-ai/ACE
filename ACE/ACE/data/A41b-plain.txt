Tiffany - Girl From Bay Makes It Big By Peter Haran  

  She must have been a beautiful baby, because baby, just look at her now.
  Her name is Tiffany Rowan, an 18-year-old from Glenelg who is taking the
European fashion scene by storm.
  Tiffany's climb to the top is the stuff dreams are made of - a model success
story.
  It all started three years ago when Tiffany posed in swimwear in the Sunday
Mail.  And that edge-of-the-pool shot may have been the springboard leading
her to the catwalks of Paris.
  By any yardstick, Tiffany's climb has been meteoric.  The former Rave
Agency model first made her mark as covergirl for Dolly magazine and then
it was on to the "big smoke" of Sydney and a top model agency.
  Then things happened.  Tiffany caught the eye of some of Australia's top
fashion magazines and for eight months she adorned the pages of Harper's
Bazaar, Cleo, Cosmopolitan and Mode.
  Tiffany went on to win $1000 on the TV talent show Star Search, and became
a finalist in Face Of The '80s.
  But it was while she was filming a commercial for Philips that Tiffany
got that elusive big break. 
  The film company moved to France for final shooting near the Eiffel Tower
and Tiffany promptly signed up with one of Paris' top model agencies.
  The fuse was lit and the girl from Glenelg set the European fashion scene
on fire.
  She made the pages of the English beauty magazine The Face, the Italian
fashion publication Tempo, and the French admired her in their mass circulation
publication called Vital.
  Late last week as the temperature plunged to near zero and the rain lashed
at the window of her home in Surrey, England, Tiffany Rowan was dreaming
of a sunny day down at the Bay.
  "I really want to come home for Christmas," said the girl in a whirl.
  "It's totally miserable here."
  But the miseries of the Northern winter have to be taken in her long stride
- the importance is being in the right place at the right time.
  "Jet-setting is far from all fun," Tiffany said.
  "I've been living out of suitcases for as long as I can remember.
  "I love Australia, but if you want to work with the cream you just have
to work in Europe.  And it's fabulous for Australians over here, we are
the flavor of the month.
  "You need some advantage because the competition here is incredible."
  Tiffany's next move is a natural one in the model world - acting.  "I
enrolled in a three-year course," she said.
  "I've been running up and down the length of Britain all this month 
trying to get into acting school," she said. 
  "I eventually got enrolled for a starting next September."
  But in the meantime it's back to Paris and more work under the bright
lights - a far cry from the slim-line look 15-year-old who first made a
splash in the Sunday Mail.
