	<h> Manila's protest strike fizzles out </h>
	


	<misc> Manila, 17 Nov  </misc>
	

- A general strike called to paralyse Manila in protest at
the killing of a trade union leader flopped today while officials first
announced, then retracted news that a man had been arrested in connection
with the murder.
  The Justice Minister, Neptali Gonzales, who had claimed there was an arrest
in the case, said later that informers had given police the names of two
men who stalked Rolando Olalia in the days before his death.
  Police were now seeking the men to put them in an identification parade,
he said.
  Mr Gonzales said that a car seen in Mr Olalia's neighbourhood shortly before
the kidnap had a licence plate that could have been issued to a Government
agency.
  A general strike called by Mr Olalia's 500,000-member May First Movement
interfered with bus services and led to walkouts by 30,000 workers at 120
factories - far from the numbers strike leaders had predicted.
  Manila officials suspended all classes for the city's schoolchildren
and a police spokesman said the city was calm and orderly.
  While many bus drivers appeared to be obeying the strike call, 300 of
the city's 500 buses were in operation.  Many of these were driven by soldiers
with police protection, officals said.
  The auditor's office of the Pasay City government in southern Manila
caught fire after a bomb was hurled through a window from a car.
  Police said the bombers must have wanted to destroy important documents.
