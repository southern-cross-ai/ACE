	<h> HEALTH CARE DECLINES</h>
	

&quot;It's got to the stage where people have to die before anything is done.&quot;
This disturbing statement, published on the front page of The Canberra Times
on Thursday, was made by a doctor who had tried for 10 days to have a patient
with heart trouble admitted to a Canberra public hospital. Health authorities
say the doctor &quot;clearly has not followed standard admission procedures&quot;.
Whatever the reason, it emphasises the growing frustration of the medical
profession, not just in Canberra, but in most parts of Australia, with the
shortage of hospital beds, especially for patients requiring elective surgery.
  In Canberra, it appears that the longer an elective surgery patient is
likely to be in hospital the longer he or she will have to wait for a bed.
Preference goes to those expected to be discharged within a day or so. To
get patients to hospital, some doctors have, in desperation, sent them to
casualty departments hoping that from there they would gain admittance to
a normal hospital ward. The word &quot;elective&quot; is not strong enough to convey
the urgency of the needs of many patients. Too often the word is associated
with cosmetic surgery - a facelift or a &quot;nose job&quot;. While many people accept
that cosmetic surgery has a role in improving the appearance and therefore
the self-esteem of a patient, it is generally accepted that when hospitals
are crowded the cosmetic patients should drop to the end of the queue. However,
elective surgery can be much more serious: it can reveal that the patient
is seriously ill, as when elective surgery to remove a lump reveals the
presence of cancer and the need for urgent treatment.
