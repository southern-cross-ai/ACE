Yap-Yap 

  During 1955, when the Snowy Mountains Scheme was in full swing, Eddie,
a chap who had been working there for quite a few years teamed up with
two immigrants from Hungary, named Frank and Steve. Steve had been caring
for a mongrel fox terrier type dog that was running around the camp at
Guthega, where they were stationed. One Sunday they decided to go down
along the Snowy River to do a bit of fishing, and of course, Steve had
to take the dog.
  They pulled up at a small clearing by the river, which was to be their
base for the day. Eddie and Frank went their various ways along the river,
while Steve stayed on and got a fire going and prepared a snack.
  The dog took off into the bush, hunting for anything that moved. In a
short time Steve could hear the dog, "Yap-yap, yap-yap", then the dog came
out of the bush, yapping away and following a strange looking reptile,
that was racing straight towards the camp. Steve, not knowing anything
about a goanna, or even knowing what it was, stood there with his mouth
open, perhaps wondering why it was heading towards him.
  The next event was to be one that Steve would never forget, for the goanna
clawed its way to the top of his head in a few short seconds. The dog was
yapping away madly and as blood was rolling down Steve's face and arms
from the claws of the enraged goanna, Steve gave a terrified yell. Eddie
heard the commotion, raced over and caught the dog, then threw it into
the river.
  The goanna jumped down and strutted off with head and tail high in the
air.
  As soon as the dog got out of the river, it yap yapped after the goanna
again, but by this time the goanna had found safety in a tall tree.
  Apart from being shaken up and having forty one stitches inserted where
the goanna had ripped him, Steve was quite all right.
