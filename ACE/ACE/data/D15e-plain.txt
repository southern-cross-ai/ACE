Saturday August 9 GIVING AND RECEIVING PRAY  
Thank you, my loving Parent, for all that you have given me. Today
       I specially want to thank you for ...

 READ  
Leviticus 6:14-23.

 THINK  
Submission to God.  Under Moses' leadership, the Israelites had made a
covenant, or treaty, with the Lord (Exodus 19:3-8). He agreed to be their
God while they promised wholehearted loyalty and obedience to him.
  Treaties between conquerors and their subjects were well-known to the
Israelites. As a mark of loyalty, the conquered people were required to
send a regular tribute gift to their overlord. Now, as the Israelites learnt
what it meant to be the Lord's loyal subjects, they were taught how to bring
their 'tribute gift' (for this seems to have been the nature of the cereal
offering).
  Provision from God.  In bringing this gift, the people were acknowledging
their utter and grateful dependence on the Lord and his gifts to them. As
well, they were providing for the needs of their spiritual leaders, for
the cereal offering formed the staple diet of the priests (16,17).
  The ordinance of this offering was intended to teach about giving and
receiving.
  When the worshippers took their cereal offering to the priests, to whom
were they giving it (2:1)?

From whom did the priests receive their portion (17)?

 FOCUS  
God still provides for those who serve him, but the responsibility
for giving is ours. Prayerfully consider your own giving.
- How is it determined? By the church's budget, your own financial situation,
or what?
- Does it include God's concern for the whole world?
- Is it limited to physical needs or alternatively to 'spiritual' Is it dutiful, joyful, grudging, enthusiastic?
- Is it a subject of frequent prayer?
