	<h> New shipment of antiques is on the way </h>
	

  AT THE recent Antique Show Helena Barton told me of a new shipment coming
in, so I went to Etta Antiques in Claremont for a quick preview.
  In her &quot;Chair Room&quot; I saw quite a number of long sets of chairs, among
them a lovely set of eight Regency dining chairs including two matching
carvers.
  Already on show is a very interesting French Boulle cabinet, inlaid with
brass and tortoise shell and beautifully finished with ormulu and brass
figureheads.
  I noted the fine marble top, and date would be approximately 1870.
  This Boulle design actually originated in Italy, but it was perfected
by Frenchman Andre Charles Boulle, cabinetmaker to Louis XIV of France and
responsible for much of the furniture at the famous Palais de Versailles.
  Some of the many other magnificent pieces I took special note of were
a lovely Edwardian mahogany drum desk with pull out writing slide, a truly
delightful Louis XVI style piece, a superb Regency flame mahogany secretaire
bookcase with delicate glazing bar tracery, spiral supports and a nice
brass inlay finish.
  Other items I noted were an 1826 Regency mahogany*mahogancy chest on chest with
six full and two half drawers all fitted with brass handles, as well as
an unusually fine mahogany open top sideboard, with very nicely carved supports
and the servery above.
  This piece of furniture would in fact make an excellent drink cupboard.
  There were a couple of nice desks, the first a twin pedestal desk with
lovely red leather top in mahogany and with five or six small deep drawers
on each side, all fitted with nice brass button handles.  The second
was a small mahogany French mid 19th century hand painted kidney shaped
seven drawer desk, one of those elegant small pieces not often seen.
  Finally there was also a rare George III secretaire, a very fine piece
with cross banded doors.
  It virtually leaves me no room to describe some of the very fine pieces
of jewellery and porcelain also on display at Etta Antiques in Claremont.
