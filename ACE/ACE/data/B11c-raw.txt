	<h> Sir Joh and the terrorists </h>
	

  THE Premier, Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen, already on the election stump,
made some outrageous claims this week about terrorists and the Federal
Government. To give the impression that the Government is deliberately
promoting terrorism was going too far even for an election campaign.
  It is however, interesting to note that Sir Joh made exactly the same
claim in October last year without incurring the wrath of his Labor opponents.
If the Prime Minister had continued to dismiss such claims without
over-reacting, it might have been better for Labor's chances in the coming
State election. His personal remarks about Sir Joh were in extremely poor
taste. 
  However, the Premier would not have been far out if he had suggested the 
Federal Government may be - and it must be said that it would be unintentional 
- helping terrorists.
  The Defence Minister, Mr Beazley, has admitted that 25,000 rounds of
ammunition produced at the Army's munitions factory at Footscray have not
been accounted for. The minister has also been reported as saying a former
employee at the factory has been charged with stealing about 500 rounds.
A television current affairs reporter found after his own investigation
that the security was a joke.
  What an invitation this is to terrorist sympathisers or to terrorists
themselves. Australia has to take into account not only international, but
also internal, terrorism.
  It should not be necessary to say that everything must be done to ensure
that security is as efficient as possible. Obviously, there is something
wrong with the security at the munitions factory.
