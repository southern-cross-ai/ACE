JANINE BURKE'S first novel `Speaking', gave the reader five distinct speaking
voices. Voices of women arguing, exploring, consolidating and
disintegrating*distintegrating. Burke wrote powerfully of being a woman,
about woman as a psychologically complex being: a social, political,
imaginative and family person, strong, vulnerable, tough, fragile. She wrote
from a position which recognises historical pressures as well as
opportunities.
  `Second Sight', Burke's second novel, continues this thorough gazing into
being a woman. The opening sentence - &quot;My grandmother died with her mouth
open.&quot; - concentrates the focus. Death and detail. Lucida, history teacher in a
college, has chosen not to live with Jason, has become lover of Lethe and is
writing a biography of Lydia O'Shea, suffragette. Burke sets her parameters:
woman, teacher, writer.
  All worlds come into collision with the death of Lucida's grandmother. Time,
place and characters emerge in keeping with their emotional significance for
Lucida. Burke shifts her focus in much the same way as Lucida's photographer
lover moves his. However, while images of the physicality of life bombard the
senses, and grandmother's death casts an emotional net over Lucida's life,
psychological holes leave gaps in the reader's understanding of why this should
be so.
  The novel is in three sections. In the first, Burke skilfully presents
someone on the verge of a nervous breakdown. The fragmentation in the narrative
isolates incidents and reinforces disintegration. This is unsettling for the
reader and is meant to be. But so are the imagist, Swiftian expressions of
Lucida's chaos. Thrust into this state are the naif, photographic,
old-fashioned pen sketches of characters. The reader nimbly dances through
this collage.
  Janine Burke tells us that we can &quot;see our symmetry. Our sad design&quot;. But,
&quot;This is the gift of second sight, the eyes granted later, when fear is gone&quot;.
The reader (as the writer, as we do in life) sees the connections in
retrospect. Second sight is not an insight; it is an affirmation of a
meaning.
  Burke uses photography as a metaphor for one kind of vision of life. It is
Lethe's eye view of the world - I am a camera. He deals in images, fragments of
life, surface realities or what the beholder beholds. &quot;He was leaving it to
the observer to make him up. It was not a game. He took the prospect of
revelation too seriously.&quot; So does Burke. Lucida needs connections -
emotional and intellectual. Her previoius discipline, history, provided an
umbilical interpretative method. Burke questions the security embedded in
this approach - the happy hooker synthesis of scholarly research. &quot;The
discipline of history was bondage and I was the whore with the whip.&quot;
  It is this fragmentary image of life which Burke is very good at. And her
dialogue pursues an intellectual thought or careless comment with ease.
However, the heavy symbolism of nomenclature overworks in creating
significance - Lucida, Lethe, Diana, Pico (Apollinaire), the Dragons (false).
From the pit of Lucida's despair, Diana and Pico appear and initiate her into
life of the moment. Diana and Pico (Apollo), twin life forces, are sensual,
sexually magnetic, hedonistic and, more importantly, free.
  Romantic (as in Keats, Shelley) images of flight dominate section two with
the arrival of Zeus's headache. My own wings are clipped by reason and I have
an imaginative unwillingness to fly with these mythological creatures. &quot;She
said, `Come to us'. The flying feeling returned, much stronger, and I floated
up, staring into Diana's eyes. It was terrifying, exquisite and real. My body
was shared with the air. It had a new substance, other dimensions, fresh
perimeters.&quot;
  I am happy to picnic with them on the banks of the Yarra - moon, but no
mention of the mozzies - but on wings of Poesy ... with Diana and Apollo!
  Lucida, letting go Lethe and Australia, flies to Italy. In section three she
experiences rebirth, a sexual and creative freeing. The image of the cave
predominates. &quot;We would speak as author and character, no longer the
disappointed detective and the missing clue. My dream came back and with it
the steady breathing. I knew I could find the cave, snaking through the belly
of the hills. I would travel light, making maps.&quot;
  Finally, her albatross, the biography of Lydia O'Shea, is laid to rest by
(literally) Lydia's ghost. I'm not sure what Janine Burke is up to here. Is
this to be read as an allegorical ghost? Is this the culmination of a nervous
breakdown, even if all the symptoms are ones of recovery? Is this an
imaginative absorption of the ghosts that haunt one? It is somewhat ironic
that Lucida thinks at the end of the novel, &quot;We began with illusions and ended
up in puffs of smoke. Such is the fate of symbols.&quot;
  Janine Burke appears to be moving into an allegorical and self-conscious
mode. She feels the need to tell us this is fiction, to provide a map. &quot;Destiny
is fierce and writing fiction shadows destiny. Alarmed at one point by the
apparent collaborations between fiction and my life, I said to Lydia, `I
shouldn't have written it in*it the first person. Dangerous correspondences
keep occurring'.&quot; This is both a disclaimer and an apologia. There appears to
be a proliferation of authors telling us not to believe that this is their life
- well, not all of it.
  Burke is a strong writer with an eye for physical realities, a great deal of
psychological and emotional texture and a great sense of historical truth. Keep
the faith. We need novels which place people in society as well as
relationships.
