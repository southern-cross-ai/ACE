STILL CASH AND TIME TO GAMBLE 

Times are tough. Money's short, we are told, and the economy's not in the
best of health. But, amazingly, we still can find the time and cash to have
a flutter, particularly on Melbourne Cup Day.

  Apparently we cannot resist the temptation to live up to our world-wide
reputation as enthusiastic sports who'll bet on anything, including flies
crawling up a wall.
  And we've got the figures to prove it.
  Within a period of just 24 hours this week NSW punters wagered the amazing
amount of $30 million on just two events - Monday night's Lotto draw and
yesterday's Melbourne Cup.
  And that doesn't include the rest of yesterday's races, or the various
other forms of legal - and illegal - gambling we indulge in like scratch
cards and poker machines, blackjack and two-up.
  Lotto's prizemoney pool - the amount distributed among the winners - on
Monday night amounted to a massive $12.7 million, including the Division
1 prize of $7 million, shared by 11 syndicates.
  Yesterday the State had an enormous $16.4 million punt on the Cup itself
or more than $17 million if we add the TAB in the ACT, which also works
as the Northern Territory TAB.
