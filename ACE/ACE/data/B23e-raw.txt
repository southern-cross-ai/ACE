  Over the next fortnight, the Brisbane Olympic Games delegation will filter
into the small Swiss city of Lausanne, on the shores of Lake Geneva.
  The Queensland capital will be on centre stage before the elite of the
Olympic movement - the delegates to the International Olympic Committee.
  At stake is the 1992 Olympics. We may win the right to host the Games,
but we have already been highlighted to the world through an adventurous
and successful campaign.
  Sydney lawyer John Coates and his Olympic Project Office team have put
Brisbane clearly on the world map.
  Lord Mayor Sallyanne Atkinson can rightly say Brisbane is now on equal
footing with those other great cities of Paris, Barcelona and Amsterdam.
