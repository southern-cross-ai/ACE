US air fares cut by 25pc  

CONTINENTAL Airlines slashed its Sydney - New York economy fare by 25 per
cent yesterday as a price war flared again.
  For business and first-class passengers, the saving is two tickets for
the price of one.
 Continental's new economy return fare to the Big Apple is now $1,399 -
undercutting its rivals by $505.
  Mr Col Hughes, general manager of Continental, said the new price had
been introduced to mark the start of the airline's one-stop direct flight
from Australia to New York on October 26.
  He said passengers who bought return first or business class tickets on
the flight would receive a second ticket free.  The new economy fare will
not be available during the peak Christmas period.
