Watchdog bound in fraud hunt By Matthew Stevens  

  CHAIRMAN Henry Bosch says the National Companies and Securities Commission
has neither the staff nor the money to chase the corporate fraudsters.
  He says it has never successfully trapped an insider trader, that illegal
share warehousing occurs often without punishment and that the growth of
"sharp business practice" is damaging the already battered reputation of
the business community.
  In recent weeks, world headlines about the insider trading of Wall Street's
fabulously scandalous Ivan Boesky has focused attention on the level of
insider trading in our own markets.  According to Bosch, insider trading
happens frequently but is almost impossible to prove.
  To emphasise his point, he produced a computer print-out showing a dramatic
improvement in a small company's share price.  He said the real price growth
happened two weeks before an "absolutely vital press announcement on a
new contract".
  He said:  "But to go from that information to finding out who did the
business and then prove that he knew about the contract before the information
was made public is very difficult and very, very costly.  We could not afford
to chase all the insiders."
  But that, he says, is not the biggest problem.  Bosch sees collusion
as the greatest threat to the sort of equality of opportunity for shareholders
which he believes is why regulation should exist in the first place.
  "There have been frequent cases of collusion in which nominally independent
bodies have acted in a way that is mutually supportive.  If the agreements
had been written down, those actions would have certainly been in breach
of Section 11 of the Companies Act.  But, as we all know, these agreements
are never written down and it is very difficult to prove what we know to
be true."
  He added:  "I will not make specific comment, but you may draw some inference
on the present inquiries."  It was an obvious reference to the NCSC's inquiry
involving what is now an international investigation into the purchase of
a $58 million parcel of takeover-targeted Humes Ltd.
  The NCSC has an annual budget of $5.7 million.  It has eight commissioners,
three full-time and five part-time, and 82 permanent staff of whom about
30 have resigned this year alone.
  Like other Public Service bodies which  attempt to deal with the highest
level of the business community, the NCSC has tremendous trouble recruiting
the best staff because of its "highly inappropriate" Public Service salaries
and conditions.
