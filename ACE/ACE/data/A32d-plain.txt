Federal Cabinet Cruises Through A Stormy Session SYDNEY. -  

Jackhammers drowned out any controversial press questions on
mining Kakadu National Park, and the Minister for the Arts, Mr Barry Cohen,
looked like a tourist with his video camera as the Prime Minister, Mr Bob
Hawke, and Federal Cabinet prepared to put to sea yesterday.
  This is the Royal Australian Navy's 75th anniversary year and the 16
ministers boarded HMAS Stalwart at Garden Island yesterday morning to mark
the historic occasion with an equally historic first - Federal Cabinet's
first meeting at sea.
  After the meeting, with the Cabinet still on board, HMAS Stalwart sailed
from Garden Island to rendezvous with the destroyers HMAS Sydney and HMAS
Perth for exercises.
  As his ministers enjoyed a cuppa on the flight deck, Mr Hawke inspected
the guard and the Navy band - members of which were beginning to look
decidedly chilled.
