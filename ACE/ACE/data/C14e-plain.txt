Good old family entertainment  

WHEN an Eastern States critic described "Frog Dreaming" as "the kind of
B-grade film we all remember from Saturday matinees," producer Barbi Taylor
was not at all offended.
  "To be perfectly honest," she said in Perth this week, "that's the kind
of entertainment we need.
  "The style of film-making has changed from making wholesome family films
to films that are more violent. There's a huge gap in the market for this 
kind of `Saturday matinee' film."
  Taylor should know about markets. As a producer she's at the business
end of film-making, though she likes to exercise strong control over the
creative side as well. Post-production, when the raw elements of the film
are turned into the finished movie, is her favourite part of the process:
"I find it's a pleasurable experience; actual shooting can get a little
harrowing."
  Taylor has been involved in more than 15 films since leaving Perth in
1970 to seek wider experience in the film industry. "Frog Dreaming" is
the latest.
  Her decision to cast Henry Thomas, the child star of "E.T.", rather than
a local actor was criticised. But she defends it: "He was the star of the
greatest money-making film of all time. He wanted to do `Frog Dreaming'.
Am I going to stop him?"
  Thomas plays an irrepressible 14-year-old whose fascination with an
unexplored water hole leads to some frightening discoveries. The film is
described as a "rites of passage" for the young boy. - Mike van Niekerk
