	<h> AN EXCITING NEW BIBLE-READING EXPERIENCE FROM SCRIPTURE UNION </h>
	

Scripture Union, whose Bible-reading notes have a total worldwide circulation
of 1,300,000 in 58 languages, has just taken a major step forward.

A fresh and lively approach to God's word.

Hot off the press comes ALIVE TO GOD, a brand new series of Bible-reading
notes for adults. This vibrant new series was launched at Scripture Union's
recent Easter Conference in Adelaide.

`We're all excited by ALIVE TO GOD', said John Lane of the Scripture Union
National office at the launch. `It's designed for those who are starting
a daily time with God which they've never had before - and for those who
want to put a new life into the time they already spend with God each day.'

Colin Matthews, head of Scripture Union's Bible Use Department in London,
visited Australia for the launch. ALIVE TO GOD was `born' in his office,
but has been adapted for use in Australia and New Zealand. He said, ALIVE
TO GOD provides a fresh and lively approach to reading God's word. We've
subtitled it `Bible guidelines for living by the Spirit' because it also
offers practical applications and suggestions for prayer, praise, confession
and meditation.

ALIVE TO GOD will help Christians engage in active dialogue with God and
will bring to life that time we spend in God's presence each day.
