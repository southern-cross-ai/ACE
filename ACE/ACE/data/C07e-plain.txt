Snow White the post-punk CHILDREN'S TV Fiona McIntosh  

  IN the bright blue bowels of the Open Channel studios in Fitzroy, a group
of excited 10-year-olds were learning that show business wasn't all it's
cracked up to be.
  You had to do a lot of standing around, you know, waiting for cues, repeating
scenes when things went wrong, wearing weird clothes and heaps of make-up
... and on top of all that you had to remember your lines.
  But, you do get your face on TV.
  After six days of filming, and countless weeks of preparation, the result
of all this effort will be a 15 minute film ... but a mighty fine 15 minute
film which will be shown on the ABC next year in the Kaboodle children's
television series.
  PRODUCED by the Children's Television Foundation, Kaboodle will be 13
half-hour programs, a melting pot of animation, live action and puppetry
from up-and-coming film makers working round Australia.
  Each mini-film within the half-hour segments runs from between two and
20 minutes, and all will feature experienced actors and actresses ... apart
from one.
