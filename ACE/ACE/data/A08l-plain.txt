Bored Mulray will quit morning radio  

  CHEEKY morning radio announcer Doug Mulray has quit 2MMM - and he's planning
to join the ranks of the unemployed.
  Mulray will leave in five weeks when the current radio rating survey ends.
  Mulray said he is leaving "because I'm tired of being a breakfast radio
announcer after seven years".
  "I want a job where I get home at 4 o'clock in the morning instead of
having to get up at 4 o'clock in the morning," he said.
  Mulray says he is going on an extended holiday and when he returns he will
start looking for a new job.
