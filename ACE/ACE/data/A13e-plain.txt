Kanak leader's home attacked By LENA SAVOPOULOU NOUMEA, 17 Nov.  

 - The home of the Kanak leader, Mr Uieiwene Uieiwene, president
of the three Loyalty Islands off New Caledonia, was attacked last night.
  Three men are reported to have fired shots at his home and to have tried
to burn it down.  Mr Uieiwene is in Paris with the two other pro-independence
leaders to meet French officials.
  Mr Uieiwene's wife and three children were believed to be in the house
at the time of the attack.  Guards posted at the house in case of trouble
drove off the attackers.
  The Noumea printing works of the `Bwenando' newspaper was destroyed by
fire last night.  The newspaper is the organ of the proindependence Kanak
coalition.
  The atmosphere was calm in the city today but trouble is expected tomorrow
with the funeral of the 14-year-old boy shot dead in clashes between pro
and anti-independence militants.
