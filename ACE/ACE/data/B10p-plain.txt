Water rate a ripoff   

MY wife and I were measured to use 575,000 litres of water in the 12 months
to 19/8, an average of 1575 litres a day.
  Modified use and little garden watering since has consumed 61,000 litres
in 62 days, a rate of 359,000 litres a year, without normal garden watering
in summer. 
  How then can the MMBW defend statements in its brochure that a typical
water user consumes only 250,000 litres a year and that a high water user
is around 350,000 litres when there are only two adults in our house and
we are not wasteful.
  If we're going to have to pay higher rates, God help those with big
families.
