Fans `acted like a lynch mob'  

A COLLINGWOOD cheer squad member yesterday said fans behaved like a lynch
mob after the defeat by the Sydney Swans on Saturday.
  David, 15, of Altona, said he saw elderly women, men and children abuse
umpires after the Swans' controversial one-point victory.
  He said three men punched one umpire and pushed around and spat on another,
while disgruntled fans threw mud at a goal umpire.
  "I felt disgusted that this sort of thing could happen in football, but
could see why they did it," he said.
  "The umpiring cost Collingwood the game."
  David who did not want his surname used, said he saw at least 1000 irate
Collingwood fans converge on the ground after the game.
  "You could feel in the air that something was going to happen," he said.
  "It was like a lynching mob, a riot.  Supporters came from everywhere.
  "I heard on the radio that only drunken louts were involved, but there
were all sorts of people.
  "Old ladies, men and kids yelling at the umpires to `give us a go'."
