	<h>$9.95 YELLOW BOOK MEAL </h>
	

The Yellow Book Cafe has been popular as a charming, alfresco*alfreso oasis of
good food at modest prices ever since it opened as an adjunct to the Yellow 
Book restaurant.
  Now the Yellow Book Cafe, of 1 Kellet Way Potts Point - corner of Ward Ave 
and Roslyn St  - has moved inside for winter and is offering tremendous value 
in a $9.95 three-course menu.
  Enter the gates of the gracious house, pass through the garden and you're 
suddenly anywhere but in the heart of The Cross.
  Start with a drink in the comfortable bar, perhaps, then dine in a 
delightfully happy, plant-filled room.
  The special $9.95 Mon-Sat menu has three or four choices in each course and 
changes regularly.
  The night we dined there, first course choices were deep-fried potato skins 
with sour cream/horseradish dipping sauce (if you don't know about these, 
take it from me they're delicious), soup, grilled mussels on shell and 
Japanese pork pancake.
  For main course, we could choose from roast of the day, chicken cacciatore, 
meat loaf stroganoff and hot beef curry with rice.
  Grilled sirloin*sirlion steak and fish of the day are $2.50 extra.
  For dessert, the choice was fresh lemon mousse, baked fruit sponge pudding 
or ice cream and chocolate sauce en vacherin.
  A hot bread roll is $1 and a bottomless cup of Cona coffee $1.50.
  The limited wine list is mainly $8.50 and $9.50.  Wine is also served by 
$1.50 glass, $3.50 half-carafe and $6 carafe.  Cocktails are $4.50.
  Payment is by cash, Bankcard, Visa or Mastercard only.
  Book for the Yellow Book Cafe on 358 4194.
