	<h> Hospice, The Entrance, NSW </h>
	

	<bl> Scott Weston </bl>
	

The design is for a hospice extension to an existing local hospital on a
flat site near the sea on the NSW North Coast.
  The need for communal activities plus a degree of individual privacy
in this design resulted in a grouping of pavilions (each identified
externally by the roof), and a series of internal garden courts. As a
`familiar' traditional load-bearing structural system was used to integrate
with the existing buildings, the unifying device was one of using the `thick
wall' and applied decorative devices expressed as formal pattern-making.
These devices were extended into the garden design as well. Some patterns were
used as nodes, others to indicate directional movement. In fact, the close
integration of garden, outdoor activities and building was the main thrust of
the design.

The design is for a hospice extension to an existing local hospital on a
flat site near the sea on the New South Wales coast.
  The design accepts the `free' use of the non-structural wall which a framing
system of construction allows. However this concept is extended to give
a richer and slightly more complex interpretation by having two grids
intersecting and exploiting the resultant grid-shift. Each `grid-system'
(the structural frame) responds to a different drummer; - one related to
the existing building, the other to a more sympathetic orientation. The
careful juxtaposition of these two `systems' and the free wall, which unites
and divides, results in a more interesting reading of the solution, presenting
sometimes clarity and direction and sometimes complexity and ambiguity.
The external skin wall is of the same material, colour and detailing as
the existing building, thus uniting and extending the established situation.



	<h> Community Centre, Parramatta </h>
	

	<bl> Gary Lewin </bl>
	
The design is for a site between refurbished river bank and formal park,
bounded by old Church Street bridge on one side, to be used for pedestrians
only, and on the other by Marsden Street with increased heavy traffic.
  The solution attempts to link river to park. The duality of the design
needs (two theatres) is used to create a classical axial solution; the main
axis cutting the building dividing it into two distinct `zones' and the
creating `a thoroughfare' from park to river terraces. The interrupted screen
wall confronts the park to create a similar formality as `backdrop'. The
designer considered that the use of traditional classical devices gave the
design the `civic' quality required by the brief.


	<h> Cultural Centre, Gosford, NSW </h>
	

	<bl> Tim Antiohos </bl>
	
The design, for a civic building for a large coastal town, is to incorporate
the major features of a theatre, multipurpose hall, and art gallery.
  The overall design concept, while formal, allows for a response to the
environmental parameters set up by the physical nature of the site and its
orientation. The result is an expression of the three major uses as individual
elements, carefully juxtaposed in relationship to each other with individual
responses to their own particular site location. The overall a priori formalism
however sets these three crits seemingly on a collision course, -
metaphorically described by the sculptured `disintegrating wall' and by
the overlapping landscape design. The overall building complex is kept
restrained in form and colour (black and white) to highlight is*its formal
monumentality and to give a neutral background to the planting of the parkland
around.


	<h> House at Mackeral Beach, NSW </h>
	

	<bl> Peter Scott </bl>
	
The site is in a fringe area of Sydney, originally a holiday resort developing
an outer suburban character. At present the only approach to the site is by
water and all supplies including building materials have to be shipped across.
  This work is more by way of an exploration of design `elements' and the
search for an `architectural manifesto' by the designer. The views from
the sloping site, the nature of the use, the celebration of entry, the
importance of the concept of a `retreat' within the complex, are all features
considered, which are still governed by the parameters of construction and
series, orientation, and so on.


	<h> Commercial development, The Rocks, Sydney </h>
	

	<bl> Mark Pearse </bl>
	
This design is for a commercial venture for mixed development in the historical
area of The Rocks in Sydney. It is traditional in its basic approach, and uses
a simple framing system of construction, with facades that confront a street
at each end of the site, and allows for a light-court in between. However
there is an implied `low-scale' nature to the development to suit the character
of the area. Thus the frame is expressed as a control, and this allows a
variety of infill between : solid/void, projections/recessions, textures,
and so on, as a response to the use within, and to allow for the personal
expression of the occupants by way of decorative devices, blinds, signs,
etc.


	<h> Office Block, Elizabeth Street, Sydney </h>
	

	<bl> Mark Ian Jones </bl>
	
The site is a narrow commercial block which joins two major streets Elizabeth
Street, (facing Hyde Park) and Castlereagh Street (narrow, with many early
commercial and public buildings to be retained).
  This design has accepted the role of the facade as a major aspect of the
design but not as a decorative unrelated exterior. The freedom of internal
planning which modern technology allows is expressed. The building therefore
`signifies' the structure/use/type in a Modern sense, but at the same time
sets up a traditional proportioning game with the fenestration to relate
to the buildings' context. This design attempts to amalgamate the Modern
structural aesthetic and the classical tradition in one elegant understated
whole.


	<h> Sculpture for library interior centre </h>
	

	<bl> Belinda Montgomery &amp; Ron Pointon </bl>
	
This sculptural form is the response to a `design-and-construct' experiment
related to a study of interior space. Emphasis was to be given to considering
space/form relationships, use of lighting, movement and perception, and
to the nature of the `scale' of whole environment. To concentrate these
issues, a single area was to be chosen from designated areas within the
new NSWIT library.
These two designers chose the stairwell, - a tall cylindrical space topped by 
a glass roof with the winding form of the stair clinging to the wall and rising
five floors. This design emphasises the verticality of the stair, responds to 
the existing winding form and the stripped-down elegance of the structure, and 
becomes itself a metaphor for the building's use and part of communication as 
art. The whole `object' is the elegant expression of one material (steel) and 
of the fine detailing that can follow.


	<h> History Studies </h>
	

The History strand of the NSWIT architecture degree course is closely
associated with the teaching of design. Primarily the educational objectives
are to develop a critical approach to the design process by the detailed
analysis of historical models, and thus to use architectural history as
a source for a body of theory related to the design of the built environment.
This then becomes the basis for understanding and evaluating excellence
in all such design, as well as a `language' for criticism which students
can use as part of their individual design skills.
  The history programme is allocated one or two hours per week from Year
1 to Year 5 with a high percentage of workshop sessions conducted in a studio
situation, with a minimal number of formal lectures. In Years 1 &amp; 2, historical
models are not necessarily presented chronologically and this is a broad
cross-cultural view of architectural design concepts; but in Years 3 to
5 a more detailed study of the European experience is considered in a
chronological format. Fifteenth-century Italy is seen as the beginning of
the development of modern architectural theory.
  The number of written essays for assignments are kept to a minimum and
a good number of three-dimensional analyses of specified historical works
(models &amp; drawings) are required instead, to encourage students to think
of these examples primarily in design terms.
