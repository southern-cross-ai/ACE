Uniform theft sparks police alert  

STOLEN police uniforms and a rifle may be used in an armed holdup while
attention is focussed on today's Papal visit, police warned yesterday.
  Two police shirts, a cap and a .22 rifle were stolen from the Banyo police
station on Sunday night.
  Nundah detectives believe the uniforms may be used by bandits to
impersonate police officers.
  A spokesman said the culprits may attempt the robbery while the majority
of police are on security duty for Papal tour.
  But police do not expect the stolen uniforms to pose a security risk
for the visit.
  The rifle, which did not have a firing mechanism, was not police issue.
