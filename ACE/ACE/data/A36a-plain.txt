Dollar's crash has claimed another victim By Susan Hely  

BUYING a cheap, good used car is becoming a thing of the past.  Over the
past 12 months cars have done an incredible shrinking act.
  Twelve months ago, $5,000 would have bought a four-year-old car such as
a Laser or Colt or perhaps a six-year-old Mazda 626.  Since then the price
has jumped at least $1,000 and still rising.
  Used car salespeople say this is partly the result of owners keeping their
vehicles, rather than buying a new one, because of the huge rises in new car
prices, triggered by the recent drop in the Australian dollar.
  The outlook for new motor vehicles is poor.  Total sales this year are
tipped to fall 24 per cent, from last year's record 695,000 to 525,000.
  Car owners who are selling are acutely aware they can get quite a bit
more than they could have, say, 12 months ago.  They will need it if they are
thinking of replacing the old car with a new one.
  Some used cars are selling for more than the owners originally paid for
them.  This is the case for the Honda City.  The 1984 models, with 30,000
kilometres on the odometer, are selling in a range of $8,000 to $8,900, according
to last week's Sun-Herald classifieds. They cost $7,500 new.     
  The owners of these cars are aware that the replacement price has risen
sharply and a new Honda City is selling for a little more than $10,000 (plus
the on-road costs).
  The argument for buying a new car now is that they will hold their resale
value and will keep rising given the outlook for the Australian dollar.
  The car salespeople claim there is something to be said for scratching
funds together to buy a new car.
  And it is tempting to consider the possibility - until you do the sums.
  If a 1980 automatic Mazda 323 costs $6,000 at present, what is the cheapest
possible new car going to cost?  Well, one which is comparable is a Mitsubishi
Colt, but on the road a new one will cost around $11,000.
  So perhaps there's nothing for it but to scour the motor market pages or
maybe consider the possibility of leasing a car occasionally.
  This is a particularly good idea for someone who lives close to public
transport or in the inner city.
  For example, it can be cheaper (but not as convenient, of course) to lease
a car from time to time and make do with a mix of public transport and taxis
for the rest of the time.
  The NRMA claims a modest late-model car costs around $100 a week to run
- excluding petrol.  A luxury imported car is twice that.
  By comparison, renting a modest car for one day a week will cost $39.
  The NRMA's survey shows that it costs $5,153 a year, excluding petrol,
to run a family car like a 1986 Toyota Corona automatic sedan if you drive
15,000 kilometres a year.  That's about $99 a week.
  But if you decided to rent the same Corona every second week between 4
pm Friday and 10 am Monday, you could do it for $2,492 a year or $48 a week.
 In both cases petrol is extra.
