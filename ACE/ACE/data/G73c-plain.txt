When it comes to truth pollies dish out Clayton's By Robert Haupt  

DEMOCRACY is the system that lets you know when a nuclear reactor blows
up. The other one keeps the whole thing secret until the geiger counters
go off their dial a thousand kilometres away, revealing that the radioactive
clouds had at last drifted into a democracy. It was not the West that began
using Chernobyl for propaganda purposes; it was the Soviet Union, by refusing
to disclose the accident when it happened.
  When we get a clear-cut incident like this, we can see that democracy
is comparatively good: not only less evil but more efficient, too. The trouble
is, you can't go on for ever basking in the reflected glory of comparisons.
Life is indeed a wonderful thing compared to the alternative but you've
got to get on with the chancy business of living it: glad to be alive, sure,
but knowing that to be alive can be sad.
  And when you look at what democracy is, rather that what it isn't, you
find that it is difficult to admire.
