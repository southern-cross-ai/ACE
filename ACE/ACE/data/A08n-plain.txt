BOY, 9, CATCHES FALLING BABY GIRL  

A 9-YEAR-OLD boy who caught a 17-month-old baby after she fell two storeys
from an apartment building says he wasn't sure he was going to catch her.
  "I was afraid I just might miss her because I'm not too hot at catching,"
said Joey Rains, of Newark, California.
  "But I believed in myself so I got right underneath her and I caught her."
  The boy saw Sara Wolf standing on a table near an open second-storey window
on Monday night, as she started pushing against the insect screen.
  He shouted at her to stop and ran about six metres to a spot below the
window.
  As he did so, Sara fell, did a half-somersault and landed on her back
in his arms.
  She was unhurt by the fall.
