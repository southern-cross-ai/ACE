	<misc> THE SONG COMPANY
Director: Charles Coleman
Recital for Musica Viva Australia
Music by British, French and Flemish composers.
Art Gallery of NSW, August 19 </misc>
	

  NO OTHER vocal group in Sydney, large or small, is quite as successful
in conveying enjoyment in its labours as The Song Company. Here are eight
singers and a conductor obviously in love with singing.
  There is no evidence that the periodic changes of personnel which The
Song Company has undergone in its two years of existence have been detrimental.
The current team is excellently balanced. Even in acoustic conditions of
reverberation that can add an echo of more than two seconds to forte chords,
the cross-fire of short syllables in pieces like Il Est Bel Et Bon by Passereau
or the fifth of Britten's Flower Songs remained very effective, and the
whiffs of tonal grapeshot in a battle piece by Jannequin scored nothing but
bullseyes*bulleyes.
  Particularly reassuring was the fact that, except in one or two brief moments
during Josquin's Lament for Ockeghem, there was no deterioration of tone
quality when only a smaller section of the whole ensemble was singing, as
in various items for four or five voices.
