 - A ballet about chess comes to the Melbourne stage tonight,
Australia's world-famous dance knight, Sir Robert Helpmann, playing a king.
  The ballet is Checkmate, the role, the Red King, which Sadler's Wells
Ballet founder Dame Ninette de Valois created for Sir Robert 49 years ago.
  In those days, Sir Robert, 28, had to pretend he was a tottery old man.
 Today, at 77, he doesn't have to pretend very much, although he exaggerated
his fragility yesterday at the Victorian State Theatre.  &quot;I'm very thrilled
about tottering on in this role,&quot; Sir Robert said.
