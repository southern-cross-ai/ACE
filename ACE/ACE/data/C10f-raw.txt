	<h> Macbeth to music </h>
	

SHAKESPEARE'S play Macbeth has been transformed into a very funny musical
by pupils of the Jamboree Heights Primary School.
  King Macbee and The Walking Tree was only supposed to be shown once, but
it proved such a hit with audiences at the weekend that another performance
could be just around the corner.
  The adaptation was written by Bruce Clark and produced by the children,
with the help of five Year Seven teachers who also directed the play.
  &quot;The children have had so much fun preparing for the production, making
the props and the scenery. Mothers helped make the costumes,&quot; teacher Muriel
Johnson said yesterday.
