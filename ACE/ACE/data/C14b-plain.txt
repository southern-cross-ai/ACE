Slimmer Patty gets her pound of flesh  

  POOR, put-upon Patty Duke Astin. Has ever a woman suffered so much, so
long and so often for the pleasure of us at home?
  She has acted as a child  basher, an alcoholic, the wife of an alcoholic
and a rejected wife. Tonight she goes one further - a fat rejected wife.
  The movie is Channel Seven's "Before and After" and it is inspirational
indeed to those of us who carry the odd curve too many.
  However, for the situation to be genuinely comparable you would need
to have a piggish husband who leaves you when he turns 40, all because of
those extra kilograms.
  So what does a rejected  wife do? She goes on a diet, of course, loses
20-odd kilograms, finds that men like her again and that life without a
husband is not such a bad thing at all.
  The creepy husband comes crawling back and what does she tell him? Watch
it and see.
  It seems to me that there is a moral here. All husbands of fat wives beware:
Your ugly duckling might turn into a swan and leave you to weather your
mid-life crisis all by yourself.
  "Before and After", apart from having an awful title, isn't anywhere
near as bad as it sounds. Patty Duke Astin is nothing if not a polished
actress and the movie has some very human moments.
  After all, don't they say that inside every fat person, is a thin one
trying to get out?
