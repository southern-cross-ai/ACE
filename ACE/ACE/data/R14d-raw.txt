	<h> The Painted Snake </h>
	

  Bill and Mary had been married for about 12 months. As usual, for a Saturday
afternoon, Bill went up to the `local' for a few ales and a yarn to the
boys.
  After a few hours a 'phone call came through for Bill. Mary was on the
other end. &quot;Bill&quot;, said Mary, &quot;There is a big brown snake on the verandah!&quot;
  From Bill, &quot;Don't be telling me about it, get the shotgun and shoot it.&quot;
  Mary said, &quot;No, I haven't shot a snake before.&quot;
  Bill interrupted with, &quot;Shoot it.&quot; Then put the 'phone down and turned
around to the boys, &quot;Woman's got to learn to kill a snake, a man could
be a hundred miles away.&quot;
  On the verandah was one snake, also five new one gallon tins of paint
of different colours. The paint had been bought by Bill in the morning
and lined hurriedly up against the wall.
  Bill arrived home much later, also very chirpy. By this time the house
lights were out and Mary was in bed. Bill called out, &quot;How'd you get along
with old `Joe Blake' love?&quot; Quietly from Mary, &quot;Missed it&quot;. &quot;Ha, Ha,&quot; laughed
Bill, &quot;How could anyone miss an old snake with a shotgun?&quot; No answer.
  Next morning, Bill a little seedy, sauntered out to shift his tins of
paint to the back shed.
  There were five paint tins blown to pieces, paint splattered over the
verandah and high up the wall; and of course, no snake.
