	<h> SHEAHAN APPEALS ON JUDGE'S DECISION </h>
	

THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL, Mr Sheahan, has asked a Supreme Court judge to reconsider
his protest resignation from the NSW Law Reform Commission.
  It is understood Mr Sheahan has written to Justice Adrian Roden asking
him to think again.
  Justice Roden, who is presiding over the so-called &quot;bikies' trial&quot; resigned
from the Law Reform Commission in protest against the new Judicial Commission
and comments by Mr Sheahan which he said imputed hypocrisy, bad faith and
self-interest among judges.
