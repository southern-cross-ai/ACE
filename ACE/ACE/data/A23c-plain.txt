Bubbly adds sparkle to a vintage event  

ONE of the glamor events of the Queensland bridge calendar, the Dunhill
October Congress, will be held by the Duplicate Bridge Club in Brisbane
this weekend.
  The Dunhill accommodates all those basic elements which give a congress
polish and sparkle - an excellent venue at Doomben Racecourse, immaculate
organisation and impeccable direction.  More, there is generous sponsorship
and a champagne lunch.
  If you had any bridge doubts about the coming weekend, resolve them and

  The Dunhill seems to be one of those congresses where I consistently do
the wrong thing and my best effort in four attempts has been a somewhat
jaded fourth.
  In keeping with my do-the-wrong-thing warm-up I have been helping opponents
to some rewarding contracts in recent congresses.
Dealer South.  All vul.
  Ross Dick opened the West hand with a strong no trump, and the bidding
quickly established a five-three spade fit.  Keith McDonald, in the East
seat, pushed the slam boat out with a bid of four no trumps and I
enthusiastically doubled with a five heart two ace reply.  If there had
been any doubts about the likely slam these were now quickly resolved for
it was unlikely that West would have any wasted values for the spade slam.
  Keith bid a confident six spades.  The heart lead was ruffed, three rounds
of trumps drawn and the only loser was a club to South's jack.  Indeed after
two top trumps had revealed the friendly three-two break in trumps, declarer
could have made all 13 tricks by playing on clubs and ruffing the fourth
round as the South hand holds four clubs and the outstanding trump.
