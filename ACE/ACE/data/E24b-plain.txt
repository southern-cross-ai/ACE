QUEENSLAND'S WAITING FOR YOU  

Queensland calls itself the Sunshine State and boasts about being Australia's
leading holiday destination. Here we show you how much Queenslanders have going
for them.

From the north-east corner of Australia, the finger pointing northwards is
Queensland. It sprawls for more than 1.7 million square kilometres, most of it
in the tropics, covering a land five times as large as Japan, one-fifth the size
of the United States of America, and equal to Great Britain, Denmark, the
Netherlands, France, West Germany, Italy, and Spain, combined.
