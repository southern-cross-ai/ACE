	<h> Loaded leave </h>
	

MR BURKE suggests it is illogical, Mr Hawke declares it is not sacrosanct,
and Mr Clyde Cameron, the former Labour Minister  responsible for it in
the first place, now admits it was a mistake from the start.
  Have our political leaders been blessed with sudden insight? Or is their
new found interest in abolishing the 17 1/2 per cent leave loading limited
to talking about it?
  Mr Burke's strong comments got a surprisingly positive response from Mr
Hawke, who left open the possibility of Government support for a move to
scrap the loading.
  Saying is not doing, of course, and translating the comments of the past
few days into action would be a tough assignment, especially for Labor
governments. It would be fraught with conflict - as yesterday's heated reaction
from a number of Federal Government MPs demonstrated - and it would put
a serious dent in government-union relations.
  Many workers would resent losing a benefit they have come to regard as
a right, even though logic may tell them that the leave loading is an
absurdity.  
  Perhaps the blow could be softened if the loading was scrapped in concert
with a national wage increase. At least then it need not involve an immediate
net loss of income.
  And workers might be more prepared to accept such a measure after they finally
see some evidence of the real cuts in taxation, first promised by Mr Hawke
more than three years ago.
  Meanwhile, if the Government is to consider the issue seriously, it should
also take a look at the wider question of penalty rates - another subject
that elicits occasional sympathetic noises from politicians, but nothing
in the way of concrete action.
  The old concept of the nine-to-five, Monday-to-Friday working week is
gradually disappearing, and wages need to be made flexible enough to adjust
to this changing trend.
