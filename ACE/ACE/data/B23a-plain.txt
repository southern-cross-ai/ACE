Jumping the gun  

AUSTRALIAN businessmen habitually criticise government restrictions and
regulations that limit the activities of free enterprise.
  
  Yet, on the rare occasions that a government does act to introduce greater
freedom for enterprise and competition, there is usually an equal crescendo
of complaint from the same business organisations.
  The State Government's decision to allow Queensland retailers to trade
around the clock for a month from December 15 has been received with the
predictable objections.
  There is some justification for criticism of the lack of consultation
by the Government before its bold move.
  Industrial Affairs and Small Business Minister Vince Lester justifies
the Government's decision to go ahead without exhaustive discussions by
saying it would have been impossible to arrive at agreement.
  The response to the announcement of the trial period shows there is some
justification for Mr Lester's assessment - although that, in itself, does
not totally justify sweeping and unilateral decisions by Government.
  But what should be kept in mind is the fact - as Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen
emphasised yesterday - that this is a trial only.
  He has given a firm undertaking that all interested parties will be given
the opportunity to present their case to the Government after the one-month
trial period.
  Those involved - and particularly those representatives of free enterprise
who are usually so vocal about red tape and restrictions - should accept
the Government's word and treat the trial period in that light.
  The Government must take fully into account the representations of the
wider community when it comes to make an assessment of the trial period
before introducing permanent and radical change.
