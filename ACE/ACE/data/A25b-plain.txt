Case of Misdirected Prayers  MOSQUE OFF LINE LONDON (AAP):  

  The first mosque built in Rome is claimed to be five degrees
off beam and facing Tel Aviv instead of Mecca.
  The story was broken by the Italian magazine Europeo, which is being sued
for libel by architect Paolo Portoghese.
  Portoghese claims there is no problem, but Europeo is standing by its
story.
  The Muslim League, which represents all Arab nations in Rome and is paying
$59.39 million to have the mosque built, launched an inquiry today.
  Given the speed that things are done in Italy, the inquiry probably will
take up to four months to complete.
  Plans for the mosque were drawn up in 1976, but controversy over the design
caused a long delay.       
  Changes eventually were made and work began two years ago.  Now, the marble
building is half finished.  
  The mosque is being built on a slope and that is reported to be the reason
why it is off line.
