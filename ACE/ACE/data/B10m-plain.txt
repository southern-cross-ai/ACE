Palestinians forgotten  

AS a Palestinian Australian of Christian background, I would like to
express my anger at those who organised the Papal tour.
  I believe the organisers used the Holy Father for political ends.
  While the Palestinian community in Australia was denied the request made
by their Palestine Liberation Organisation representative to meet the Pope,
Zionists were given half an hour to discuss political matters.
  How can it be that the oppressors are respected and listened to and the
victims and oppressed are denied the right to be heard?
  If Jesus was in Australia now, I strongly believe that he would surely
have refused to meet the criminals, and he would have held and prayed for
the Palestinian victims.
  After all, aren't the Palestinians the children of Jesus of Nazareth?
