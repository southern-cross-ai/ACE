	<h> Part-way on that privatisation path </h>
	

 THE chief executive of Qantas, Mr John Menadue, has again endorsed at
least some of the benefits of airline privatisation, but stopped short of
urging it should happen in Australia.
  Mr Menadue was speaking yesterday at an industry forum in Sydney.
  He said the world's airlines made a combined profit after interest charges
in 1985 on international scheduled services of about $US200 million, or
about enough to buy a single new jumbo jet between them.
  This profit represented a return of only half of one per cent on revenue
of nearly $US41 billion. 
  &quot;The airlines are making one to two per cent profit, where they need eight
to nine per cent to finance investments and maintain a reasonable profit
level,&quot; Mr Menadue said.
