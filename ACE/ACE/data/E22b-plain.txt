Cooks unite!  

The formation of international culinary organizations may be the only viable
way, writes Jane Grigson, to assure that our cooking traditions endure in
the future.
  The Boston Women's Culinary Guild began with a collection of 3000 cookery
books given to the Arthur and Elizabeth Schlesinger Library at Radcliffe
College in 1978. Since money was needed to house the books, to match a grant
from the National Endowment for the Humanities, a cookery demonstration
was organized. Not only was this, and other events, successful in raising
funds, but members of the organizing committees took such pleasure in meet
ing and talking to each other that Lora Brody and Sheryl Julian decided
to form a Women's Culinary Guild (women's because of the original event,
and because the professional culinary world in and around Boston was dominated
by men).
