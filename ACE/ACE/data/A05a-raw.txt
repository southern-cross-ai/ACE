	<h> Share bargains galore at monthly auctions </h>

Unwanted shares end up at garage sales, too.
  Partly-paid shares - forfeited by investors who fail to meet instalment 
payments - are auctioned after trading has finished at the stock exchange.
  Usually, one auction is held each month.
  It offers companies the chance to finish raising the extra capital they 
sought when making calls on their contributing shares.
 Last week, geologist-unit trust manager Graeme Foley swapped the office for 
the auction room to rap the gavel on 85,000 BA Petroleum Explorers Trust 
(BAPET) units.
  Mr Foley, manager of BA Oil and Gas Management, knocked down the lot for 
$22,100.
  The bidders paid 26c - 9c above the reserve price.
  The 17c reserve equalled the size of the call on the units. Defaulting 
shareholders can expect to recoup the difference above the reserve price.
  Why do bidders bother buying other people's discards?  Like any auction, 
they have an eye on the bargain.
  This wasn't so at the BAPET sale where the price paid was the same as the 
ordinary sharemarket value.
  Stock exchange officials say 95 per cent of forfeited share auctions involve 
mining companies, usually No Liability companies, with unpaid calls.
  Occasionally, an industrial company with partly-paid shares holds a sale.
  Investors in danger of having their shares confiscated and sold from under 
them are given six weeks' grace to pay up.
  In BAPET's case, call money was overdue on 241,000 units in the fortnight 
leading to the auction.
  Tardy payments by some investors reduced the number of shares to finally go 
under the hammer to 85,000.
  A licensed auctioneer is hired for most occasions.
  The rules specify the company gives 10 days' notice of a proposed sale to its 
home exchange.
