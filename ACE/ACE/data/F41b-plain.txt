As We Turned the Soil by Patricia Fisher, Cowra, NSW.  

  We discovered Grass Roots by accident ten years ago. Thank you for changing
the direction of our life. Looking back though I realise how innocent we
must have seemed to all those well-meaning people who warned us against
going to the country. I was city born and bred and knew nothing of the
hardships of country life. We were young yes, but with three tiny sons to
feed my husband wasn't about to throw a good job in the air and try to eke
out a living in the depths of the bush somewhere, however much we longed
to. Our babies must come first. We took the only road we felt was open to
us. A job in a small country town, sadly six hundred miles away from a much
loved family. We bought (or we and the bank bought) a huge old weatherboard
house on two blocks of land on the very edge of town.
  We set to work and dug up most of the back yard only to discover that
Glen Innes was in the middle of a severe drought.
