Puzzle as North Korean leader is reported dead  

Radio Pyongyang's broadcasts remained normal, with programs on the President's
recent visit to Moscow and upbeat music.
  If the rumor is true, sources say a power struggle might be in train and
this would explain the radio's silence on the issue.
 Officials in Seoul said South Korean national police had been on full alert
since yesterday because of "unusual North Korean movements and for fear
of any machinations by impure elements at home and abroad".  Seoul calls
pro-communist radicals in the south "impure elements".
  A Western diplomat travelling north of Seoul in the afternoon reported
seeing columns of combat-ready troops pouring north towards the demilitarised
zone (DMZ), which is only about 40 kilometres from Seoul.
  The Defence Ministry made no further comments after this morning's
announcement, but Seoul newspapers, quoting ministry sources, reported
this evening that two broadcast towers along the DMZ first broadcast the
report of Mr Kim's death.
  One report said the broadcast, beamed towards the south along the heavily
fortified zone, gave the news that he had been shot in a train.
  Officials of the United Nations Command said they had heard no such
broadcasts in the Panmunjom area of the DMZ which is policed jointly by
UN and South Korean troops.
