Rural anger brewing over compulsory tachos By Gus De Brito  

Anger over the compulsory installation of tachographs in long distance
trucks is brewing in Queensland, NSW and Victorian country areas.
  A meeting last week in Narrandera, NSW, of 35 members of the newly formed
Rural Transport Association (Riverina Branch) roundly condemned the time
and distance monitoring devices favored by the Australian Transport Advisory
Council.
  They registered concern about how they would affect rural hauliers -
particularly stockies.
  Secretary/treasurer of the Riverina branch, Mrs Mary Campbell, said this
week that RTA members were concerned about how policing of the tachographs
would affect truckers under the proposed Federal operator licensing scheme.
  She said it was feared that operators could lose their licences for years
for infringements  involving tachographs and driving hours.
  "In the country areas, it is difficult to limit driving hours," she said.
  "We are worried that farmers will refuse to load us if they feel that drivers'
hours are close to running out.
  "I don't see how they can introduce these monitoring devices for stock
carters.
  "Already, in times of drought when stock is weak, they have all sorts of
troubles.
  "It is a matter of getting stock into and out of saleyards quickly."
   Rural truckers fear that strict policing of driving hours and trip times
will dislocate longhaul country transport systems and drastically increase
operating costs and freight rates.
  The meeting was addressed by local NSW State member, Mr Jim Small.
  The association is planning a major meeting in Wagga Wagga, NSW at 1pm
on Saturday, September 27.
  The guest speaker will be West Australian Liberal Opposition backbencher,
Mr Wilson Tuckey.
