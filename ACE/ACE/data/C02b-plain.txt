By Marcus Casey Raging Compiled by Philip McLean  SO DAVID IS AHEAD  

ECCENTRIC Talking Heads singer/guitarist David Byrne has made his debut
in the world of film direction.
  The film is True Stories, which he helped write and is based on people
Byrne read about in tabloid newspapers.
  He also wrote a book to accompany the film, which contains a storyboard,
lyrics to songs, and photos. 
  A new Talking Heads album will be released with the film and book later
this year.
  True Stories is set in the fictional town of Virgil, Texas, during the
 State's 150th anniversary.
  "The people in the film seem to have found some kind of ethical centre,"
Byrne says in the book.
  "They may be floundering but it's a noble kind of floundering.
  "They are setting a good example and I'm trying to appreciate them." 
  Some of the characters highlighted include a Miss Rollings, the world's
laziest lady.
  She spends all her time lying in bed surrounded by gadgets which carry
out almost all of  things she wants to do without her lifting 
much more than her finger.


 Flying high!  

 - SYDNEY-based rock outfit The Cuckoos - who showed lots of promise a couple
of years ago with their EP On The Ghost Train - have released a debut mini
album. Called Sticks And Stones, the album features the single Wheels Of
Your Heart.
 - The band started off in Adelaide when three young English migrants got
together to jam with guitars and keyboards. Then they moved to Melbourne
where Merseysider Terry Burgan joined the band on bass.
 - A token Australian, Stephen Kane, stepped in to take up the position
of drummer. The band immediately poured their limited savings into recording
and distributing 500 copies of their first record, On The Ghost Train. The
EP sold out and they were signed by a management company which rereleased
the record and its single Point Of No Return.
