ONLY Hollywood could put on something as flash as The 1986 Emmy Awards.
  And not only make them work, but do them well. Nine has got them at 8.30
tonight, and it's pretty entertaining stuff.
  It would have been superb if the judges had had the wit to give all the major
awards to Moonlighting.
  Instead, Cagney and Lacey, and St Elsewhere just about hogged the lot.
  Nine would have every reason to holler; &quot;we wuz robbed.&quot;
  Still and all, it was a slick presentation, with a very funny opening
by comic David Letterman, with the glamor provided by Shelley Long from
Cheers.
  This is the 38th annual Emmy awards and it will be seen by maybe 150 million
people around the world.
  After about the first three minutes I lost track of who'd won what, or
who the bloke on the dais*dias in the penguin suit was talking about.
  You could not however, lose track of the display by apparently ageless
women such as Diahann Carroll, Joan Collins, Cybill Shepherd and Angie
Dickinson.
  For some reason unknown to mere mortals, Phylicia Rashad did not get a
guernsey as Bill's wife in The Cosby Show, while Michael J. Fox got the
nod for Family Ties as the best lead comedy actor.
  Haven't the judges ever heard of Ted Danson in Cheers, or Harry Anderson
in Night Court?
  Obviously not.
  Some old-timers were dragged out of the woodwork, including Lucille Ball
and Bea Arthur.
  These two husky-voiced old troupers once co-starred in a film turkey
called Mame, which one New York critic, I think it was John Leonard, summed
up in two of the saltiest paragraphs ever to grace a page.
  He said: &quot;This is the worst film I have ever seen. They (Ball and Arthur)
sound like Knute Rockne and Jimmy Breslin in drag.&quot;
  Red Skelton makes a delightful guest appearance, apologising for not being
able to stay longer.
  &quot;I would,&quot; he said, &quot;but I've left my grand-daughter in a 
shopping trolley at the supermarket.&quot;
  Leave her there, Red, leave her there.

THE trouble with the Emmy awards is that it's up against the opening of
My Brother Tom on Ten.
  I have to resist the temptation, having watched that many mini-series
lately, to call it The Great Baby Robbery, or My Brother Tom's Boookie.
  Whose Bookie? Well.
  One of the stars, of Tom, and a most unlikely one, is Chris Mayer who
plays the Catholic punch-up merchant, Finn McCooil in a small country town
where religious tensions are running high.
  He's the town bully, and loves it.
  &quot;Everyone's always thinking `what will McCooil do next, what's McCooil
thinking?&quot; Mayer said yesterday.
  &quot;He's a sort of catalyst for the town's mixed emotions.&quot;
  Mayer, 24, was born in Trinidad, and came to Australia in 1981.
  &quot;There were only two sports in Trinidad, cricket and boxing, so I took
up boxing,&quot; he said.
  &quot;There wasn't a lot of science involved and after I got hurt a bit I gave
it away. It's a mugs' game and basically too much like hard work.
  &quot;But that basic training helped me in the part. In fact, when Tom Quayle
(Tom Jennings) actually did knock me down in the fight scene, I saw red
and had to take a few deep breaths and hold myself back.
  &quot;But basically, at heart, I'm just a big softy; if someone said boo to
me I'd run away.
  &quot;When I was taking lessons in wood-chopping from Laurie O'Toole, it was
pretty hairy. Those axes are heavy and bloody sharp, but he was a top teacher.
  &quot;And Keith Michell, as the English lawyer, was just brilliant, and so
was Gordon Jackson. Just lovely to work with; never tried to hog the show,
and I learned a helluva lot from them.
  &quot;Working on this has given me terrific confidence.
  &quot;What's my ambition? Oh, one day I'd really like to play a nice, sensitive
bloke who's not fighting people all the time.&quot;
  He's got enough talent to do that.
