Taste of victory  

IT was a fairytale victory in anybody's books.  The tiny northern Victorian
town of Korong Vale had its first victory on Saturday afternoon after
63 consecutive losses in 3 1/2 years.
  The Vale beat Mitiamo, only one spot above it on the Loddon Valley League
ladder, 12. 9-81 to 7.14-56.
  Mitiamo lost its match the previous week by 39 goals.
  Korong Vale players said before the match they had a full team and
were confident of a win.
  "If we don't win today, there's no way we're ever going to win a match,"
one player said.
