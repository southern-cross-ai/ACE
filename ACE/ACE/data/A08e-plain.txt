BEER TIPPED TO DRY UP  

BEER shortages are expected to start in Sydney by the end of the week.
  Some liquor suppliers have taken on extra stocks to prepare for an expected
escalation of a superannuation dispute involving brewery employees.
  Reports have indicated small outlets could be dry by the end of the week.
  Beer production in NSW at Tooheys and CUB has been halved.
  And a spokesman for the Bond Corporation, brewers of Tooheys, Fourex and
Swan, warned of severe shortages.
 "If we cannot reach agreement, beer will dry up around the country," said
brewing chief executive, Mr Bill Widerberg.
  "We cannot understand why the unions are pressing for another scheme
in an industry which is well serviced by excellent superannuation facilities."
  The NSW dispute will go before the Arbitration Commission today.
  Meanwhile, more than one third of Victorian hotels have run out of beer
on tap - and packaged supplies are starting to dry up.
  The action, involving six unions, has also spread to Queensland and Western
Australia.
  President of the Australian Hotels Association, Mr Daryl Washington, said
casual employees could be stood down by Wednesday.  Sixty per cent of
Victoria's 45,000 hotel employees are casuals.
  Brewers have already stood down workers who cannot usefully be employed.
  And south-East Queensland could face beer shortages as thirsty southerners
launched "beer raids" from across the border.
