WHAT OTHERS SAY
WAGES FOR MPS  

THE DAILY TELEGRAPH: Members of Parliament are in an unenviable position.
  They feel they deserve a pay rise because they have fallen behind the
community standard after failing to win catch-up flow-ons from the 1982
wage freeze.
  On the other hand, they can hardly be seen to demand pay rises while the
Federal Government is preaching restraint to everyone else. 
  However, there is a case for a moderate pay increase for MPs. If we are
to attract the best candidates to the difficult task of governing the country,
we must ensure that the salaries they can command are comparable with those
offered in the business community.
