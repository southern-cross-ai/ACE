Cagney sets her target By KATIE JOHNSTON  

CHRIS Cagney meets her match in former cop Michael Magruder on Cagney and
Lacey on Channel 7 tonight.
  Magruder is a Michigan bounty hunter played by Brian Dennehy who is in
New York after a guy who skipped bail back home. 
  Among uniformed officers he is held in awe and as one put it: "He has
brought in over 100 bail skips, has a black belt in karate, and could probably
blow away half the mid west with his arson".
  Cagney (Sharon Gless) and Mary Beth Lacey (Tyne Daly) are after the same
fellow who, among other things, is wanted for shooting a cop.
  A reported sighting at a hotel puts Cagney and Lacey into action but
a smug Magruder is all they find.
  He is arrogant, smart-mouthed, obnoxious and sexist describing Chris and
Mary Beth as a couple of `gun molls' who blew his cover.
  He also stands to make $50,000 if he catches the wanted man and gets him
back to Michigan.
  Gritting her teeth Chris tells him for the fifth time not to call her
honey and determines to catch the crim first.
  But Magruder is always one step ahead paying off witnesses for information
and gunning down others.
  Meanwhile Mary Beth is having troubles at home when she discovers her
youngest son Michael can't read. 
  She and husband Harvey (John Karlen) face $4000 tutorial bills to take
him out of the overcrowded public schools and into a private one.
  While she and Harvey argue over schooling Chris is insisting they stake
out Magruder's mobile home, a '74 Ford and follow him.
  Mary Beth is worried Chris is becoming obsessed with beating Magruder
and may suffer a breakdown.
  But their main problem seems to be their overcoats: in almost every
scene they walk in, take off their coats, take a phone call, and put their
coats straight back on to walk out again.
  They don't even get to sit down, have a cup of coffee and read the papers!
  And what sort of job is that?
  (This episode of Cagney and Lacey screens later on country stations).
   
IN the second last episode of Filmstruck, on the ABC tonight at 10.30 John
Baxter, playwright David Williamson, and composer Peter Sculthorpe reminisce
about the old days of the Saturday matinee.
  Discussing the rise and fall of the great movie palaces Baxter watches
a large suburban cinema go down under the bulldozer.
  He then visits Sydney's lavish State Theatre which has been listed by
the National Trust.
