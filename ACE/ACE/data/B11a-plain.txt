Powerful case against tax  

  THE coal mining industry has mounted a powerfully persuasive and logical
case against the fringe benefits tax. A responsive, responsible government
might well be persuaded but this Government has not given any indication so
far of listening to logical argument. Thanks to a mixture of stubbornness
and poor advice, it is in an almighty mess on the fringe benefits tax and
shows little sign of finding an easy and practical way out.
  The mining industry believes that the tax will cost an extra $17 million
a year. Another $17 million will be paid in increased company tax and
about $6 million  will come from the non-deductibility of entertainment
expenses. Of the three, however, the fringe benefits tax is attracting the
most criticism from the mining industry.
  The industry's main argument is that housing provided in remote areas
should not be treated as a fringe benefit because the houses are needed
to attract labor to those areas and, as such, is an essential and necessary
cost of production. It is a compelling argument, particularly in this State.
  The towns servicing the central Queensland coal mines are there because
of the mines; they simply did not exist before. As well, mining companies
have provided the cost of infrastructure, such as roads, railway lines
and rolling stock, which should have been a responsibility of the taxpayer.
Governments have also, through company taxation, export levies and royalties,
enjoyed their share of the mining riches.
  Times, as the mining companies point out, have changed. The great markets
for mining products are no longer there; the prices for those products are
much lower. Under these circumstances, governments should be encouraging
mining, not hitting it with extra imposts.
  The Opposition realised the difficulties in taxing miners' housing after
Mr Howard's abortive attempt in 1980. If, as it is generally expected to
do, the ALP loses the seat of Mount Isa in the State election, the fringe
benefits tax can be fairly blamed. Mr Hawke and Mr Keating are supposed
to be working on minor revisions; they will need to perform major surgery
to placate the mining companies and their employees.
