10 hurt in ferry mishap From Neil Evans in Sydney  

  Ten people were injured - two seriously - when a ferry crashed into a
wharf on Sydney Harbor today.
  The modern government ferry was returning from Taronga Park Zoo with 80
passengers when it struck the No.5 wharf near Circular Quay about 12.10pm.
  The two seriously injured are believed to be suffering from spinal
injuries.
  An Urban Transit Authority spokesman said the ferry appeared to
malfunction.  Damage had been caused to the vessel's bow.
  He said it would be out of action until a full damage report had been
completed.
  The incident was not related to the numerous visiting warships in the
harbor for the Royal Australian Navy's 75th Birthday celebrations.
