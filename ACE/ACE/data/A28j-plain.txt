Shuttle given new rockets HOUSTON:  

 Engineers have developed a new solid rocket engine design to prevent
a failure like the one that caused the explosion on the Space Shuttle
Challenger.  A U.S. Space Agency official said a team at the Marshall Space
Flight Centre in Alabama had settled on the new design in a major step towards
returning the Shuttle to flight.
  Challenger exploded on January 28 killing all seven crew members, after
a joint in its solid rocket booster failed.
  The Shuttle fleet was grounded until the rocket design flaw could be
corrected.  
  The Rogers Commission, which investigated the accident, said
two O-rings in the rocket engine joint had failed to seal, allowing superheated
gases to burn through the wall of a propellent tank.
  Fuel and oxidiser from the tank ignited, causing the explosion.
