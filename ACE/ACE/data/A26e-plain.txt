Deposits set for beverage bottles  

 Amendments to the State Government's Beverage Containers Act were approved
by Executive Council yesterday ending plans to lift deposits for non-refillable
beverage bottles from 5c to 15c.
  Non-returnable containers will now attract a deposit of 6c, compared with
the 4c deposit on returnable containers.
  The amendments were introduced when the Government found it could not
justify the planned 15c deposit after being challenged by the Bond Brewing
Company in court.
  A spokesman for the Minister of Environment and Planning, Dr Hopgood,
said yesterday it had become apparent the Government could not justify
such a large differential between returnable and one-way containers under
Section 92 of the Constitution which related to free trade between States.
