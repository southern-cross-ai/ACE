Tax chief reports  

THE bottom-of-the-harbor tax evasion era appeared to be over, according
to the Tax Commissioner, Mr Boucher.
  He said in his 1985-86 report there were no obvious signs of artificial
"paper" schemes being promoted during the year.
  As part of the bottom-of-the-harbor mop-up, $53.6 million in irrecoverable
tax from company "strip" assessments was written off in 1985-86.
  A further $160 million was written off in irrecoverable penalties for
strip company returns not lodged or lodged incorrectly.
