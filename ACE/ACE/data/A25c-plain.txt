Double killer `still in area' By Warren Gibbs  

  Police believe the Logan Reserve double murderer has gone to ground
in the area of his brutal attacks.
  Officer-in-charge Det. Sgt Neil Conway said today inquiries interstate
revealed nothing to indicate the man has fled Queensland.
  The killer, described as a "frenzied maniac", was capable of killing
at anytime, and police warned of the dangers of harboring the man.
  "He is callous murderer who has nothing to lose by killing again," Det.Sgt
Conway said.
  Det. Sgt Conway said inquiries were being centred on Brisbane's southside,
extending to the Gold Coast.
  Detectives have received more than 750 tip-offs from the public, but are
appealing for anyone with information to contact Beenleigh CIB.
