Cricket pitch  

WITH the completion of a $4 million lighting system at the WACA Ground,
Perth has the facilities it needs to host more top-class cricket matches.
  All that is lacking now is a decent programme of matches for Perth to
give the cricket-starved WA public a long overdue fair go. That will require
a change of attitude by Australia's cricket administrators and more than
a few one-off matches this summer to coincide with the America's Cup.
  Despite WA's major contributions to Australian cricket, the State has been
a poor relation when it comes to hosting big matches. For instance, though
WA has reached the final of the limited-overs competition 11 times, only
two of those finals have been staged here. The rest have been held to cash
in on potentially bigger crowds - and financial returns - in other States.
  WA cricket fans are entitled to better treatment. With the provision of
the new lights, local facilities can no longer be used as an excuse to
deny WA a better share of top cricket action.
