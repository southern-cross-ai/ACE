	<h> Fans `acted like a lynch mob' </h>
	

A COLLINGWOOD cheer squad member yesterday said fans behaved like a lynch
mob after the defeat by the Sydney Swans on Saturday.
  David, 15, of Altona, said he saw elderly women, men and children abuse
umpires after the Swans' controversial one-point victory.
  He said three men punched one umpire and pushed around and spat on another,
while disgruntled fans threw mud at a goal umpire.
  &quot;I felt disgusted that this sort of thing could happen in football, but
could see why they did it,&quot; he said.
  &quot;The umpiring cost Collingwood the game.&quot;
  David who did not want his surname used, said he saw at least 1000 irate
Collingwood fans converge on the ground after the game.
  &quot;You could feel in the air that something was going to happen,&quot; he said.
  &quot;It was like a lynching mob, a riot.  Supporters came from everywhere.
  &quot;I heard on the radio that only drunken louts were involved, but there
were all sorts of people.
  &quot;Old ladies, men and kids yelling at the umpires to `give us a go'.&quot;
