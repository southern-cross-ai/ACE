	<bl> From PETER GIBSON in Canberra </bl>
	

DEMOCRATS leader Don Chipp is set to quit politics this weekend.
  Mr Chipp plans to announce his retirement, which has been expected for
some months, on Sunday.
  A bitter struggle between deputy leader Senator Janine Haines and Victorian
Senator John Siddons is expected.
  Senator Haines is expected to win the fight which will split the party.
  The victory will make her the first woman leader of a parliamentary party
in Australia.
  Senator Chipp has been in Parliament for 25 years, spending the last nine
as leader of the Democrats.
  He quit the Liberal party after being passed over for a place in the
first Fraser Ministry.
