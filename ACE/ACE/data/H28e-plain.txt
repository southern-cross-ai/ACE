Smiles Raise $210,000  

     Volunteers' smiles, and hard work raised over $210,000 on
Red Cross Button day last December, according to the Appeal
Supervisor, Miss Shirley Wood.
     "The volunteers did a terrific job, and we expect to be
receiving money from the Christmas Appeal Button Day for some
weeks yet.
     "It's not an easy job, standing on the street, selling
buttons to people who don't want to buy them, but the
volunteers always managed a smile, which I'm sure is what sells
the badges."
     Most volunteers who took part also held street stalls,
raffles and luncheons to raise money for the Division.
     "Red Cross services could not continue without the help
from people like this."
     The next Red Cross Button Day for the Winter Appeal, is
on Friday, June 6, and volunteers from country and
metropolitan areas will be needed again.
