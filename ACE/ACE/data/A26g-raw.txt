Switzerland has assured its neighbors on the Rhine that
it will consider paying for damage caused by toxic spillage and tighten
regulations on dangerous chemicals.
  European Community Environment Commissioner Stanley Davis said the Swiss
President, Mr Egli, had made valuable concessions on the question of
compensation for heavy pollution of the Rhine following a fire at a chemical
warehouse in Basle about two weeks ago.
