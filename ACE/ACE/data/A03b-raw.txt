	<h> PM WINS HARE KRISHNA VOTE </h>
	

THE Hare Krishna cult has backed Prime Minister Bob Hawke's call to make
the unemployed work for the community.
  The shaven-headed chanters say they will take as many of the unemployed
as the CES can supply and will send them out to beautify Sydney.
  &quot;Work is very instructive to the soul and is essential if these kids
aren't going to get hooked on drugs,&quot; said Krishna spokesman Tony Foley.
  &quot;We do a lot of work in rehabilitating drug addicts.  They help us prepare
free meals for the poor and clean the streets,&quot; he said.
