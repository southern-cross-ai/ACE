Does God listen to prayer? The Rev. Peter Rice  

"All my life I never care what people thought about nothing I did, I say.
But deep in my heart I care about God. What he is going to think. And come
to find out, he don't think. Just sit up there glorying in being deaf, I
reckon. But ain't easy, trying to do without God. Even if you know he ain't
there, trying to do without him is a strain."

  THESE ARE the words of Celie, the heroine in Alice Walker's book The Color
Purple. But they could equally be the words of millions of people who, like
Celie, no longer pray to God. God just doesn't seem to hear the cries of
human suffering, so most people have stopped asking.
  And that presents a dilemma.
  On the one hand, on every Sunday, in every church, Christians pray for
God to act in this world to bring about an end to human suffering. And in
some churches it seems to work better than others - everything from backache
to ingrown toenails are healed at the drop of a "Bless you Jesus".
  And yet Christians around the world are in the vanguard of the peace movement
whose motivation is the real fear that, faith or not, four billion people
could be wiped out in a nuclear holocaust, ingrown toenails not withstanding.
