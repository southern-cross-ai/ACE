A Keating Minder?  

  Paul Keating is being urged by supporters to pull his head in - before
the Opposition kicks it in.
  At least two Ministers say Mr Keating, the ALP's toughest parliamentary
brawler, needs a "minder".
  They are urging the Prime Minister Mr Hawke to lend him a senior staffer
with sharp political instincts.
  This, the Ministers say, would save the Treasurer from politically damaging
stumbles.
  One Minister said:  "The problem with Paul is that he surrounds himself
with bright young things from the Tax Office and personal staff who are good
mates with the forex boys (foreign exchange dealers), but none of them has a
scrap of basic political nous."
  Whether Mr Keating would willingly accept advice from one of Mr Hawke's
minders is doubtful.
  In May, he appealed to Mr Hawke to discipline his minders, saying he was
in a "permanent stoush" with them.
  The stumble this week that triggered ALP concern - and gave the Opposition
such joy - was Mr Keating's admission that he was "too busy" to lodge tax
returns.
  Senior Ministers were furious at the Treasurer's failure to meet the most
basic demand of the Tax Office.
  The parliamentary row that followed the admission gave Opposition MPs the
chance to get a bit of their own back on Mr Keating, and they queued up
with glee to deliver their barbs.
  THE Keating gaffe took a lot of gloss off what had, until then, been a
good sitting for the Government.
  And the Opposition isn't finished with the issue yet.
  Senator Tony Messner, Opposition spokesman on taxation, told the Sunday
Press last night that the tax return row would be "a monkey on Mr Keating's
back for the rest of his career".
  "It will weigh down Mr Keating and the Hawke Government," he said.
 "Mr Keating's failure to lodge his own returns undermines people's faith
in this Government, that it actually means what it says.
 "The affair cast a terrible feeling of lack of sincerity."
  The tax return affair caps a bad year for the man once called "the world's
best Treasurer".
  Mr Keating's first major stumble was in May, with his "banana republic"
outburst.  
  He warned that Australia was in danger of becoming a third-rate
economy - and adverse reaction to what was an off-the-cuff radio interview
sent the dollar and the stockmarkets tumbling.
  Mr Keating has had a running battle all year with opponents to his tax
reforms, particularly the powerful lobby against the fringe benefits tax.
  When he claimed a $17,400 travel allowance for time spent away from his
home base in Sydney - while he and his family were living in rented
accommodation in Canberra, his opponents had a field day.
  Mr Keating copped more bucketing when the promised tax cuts were postponed,
and he introduced a tough Budget that imposed a broad new range of indirect
taxes.
  But feelings in his own electorate were the most serious problem of all
for Mr Keating.
  An opinion poll at the end of August showed that the Treasurer, who has
swept the NSW seat of Blaxland seven times since 1969, now had to face the
fact that his seat had become marginal.
  The survey showed that only one half of 1 per cent separated Mr Keating
from his Liberal opponent.
  Labor Party polling over the past two months has shown that the Treasurer's
abrasiveness is a political liability.
  And that was before he tried to "tough out" the row over his late taxation
returns.
  Even his friends and fellow NSW Right-wingers, including the powerful Senator
Graham Richardson, have advised Mr Keating that he had become too distant
from the broad mass of Labor voters.
  The late tax return underlines the point.  Most Australians, Labor or Liberal,
get their returns in on time.
  Mr Keating didn't file his 1985 tax return until it was more than a year
overdue, and he was three months late with his 1986 return.
  Senator Messner, a taxation agent, said: "He set a very poor example to
Australia's 6 1/2 million taxpayers.  I am fearful of the consequences
of a leading figure creating a precedent.
  "I don't know if it would be a defence for latecomers to say they were
too busy, like the Treasurer, but many will try it."
  Asked when he lodged his own return, Senator Messner said:  "I don't have
to hire a tax agent, I am a tax agent.  I put mine in in July.  I understand
the rules.
  "Mr Keating's claim that he is a busy man was rough - everybody's busy.
