	<h> Catholic book set to spark controversy within the church </h>
	 


	<misc> On the eve of the visit to Brisbane by Pope John Paul II,
TESS LIVINGSTONE reports that a new book has made Australia the focus of
attention in Rome. </misc>
	

JUST as he leaves for Australia, Pope John Paul II has been handed a book
that is sending shockwaves through the Australian Catholic Church.
  Rome or the Bush by Ballarat Catholic academic Michael Gilchrist, with
an introduction by Malcolm Muggeridge, is a damning indictment of the
performance of many of Australia's Catholic bishops and church leaders since
the end of the Second Vatican Council 20 years ago.
  Gilchrist is a former Catholic secondary school teacher now lecturing
in a Catholic teachers' college.
  Despite lack of promotion, the book has just sold out its first run of
3000 in two weeks, and orders are pouring in.
  The book poses the issue: &quot;The fruits of the new church speak for themselves.
Not only are there emptying churches, confessionals and seminaries, but
what remains of an active church continues to be drained of its Catholic
flavor a generation after the Council.
  &quot;Is this the church which Australia's Catholics want? The choice needs
to be made before long: Rome or The Bush? Time is running out.&quot;
  In 280 pages, Gilchrist outlines what many Catholics see as the abuses
and disobedience to church rules and teachings weakening the Australian
church.
  It is all there - pink elephants on the altar at Mass; priests wearing
puppet monkeys on their hands and children yelling out &quot;bananas&quot; during
Mass; the use of processed sliced bread or a tea cake for Holy Communion;
bevies of nubile young ladies, clowns and puppets dancing during Mass;
priests making up their own words to the Mass; nuns claiming that Jesus
Christ mistreated his mother; young people and trainee priests being fed
a &quot;diet of mush&quot;; with young people leaving school &quot;knowing nothing, believing
nothing, practising nothing&quot;.
  For instance: &quot;The prize for liturgical spontaneity must go to a young
Melbourne priest at a parish barbecue on a Holy Day of Obligation who enabled
the faithful to combine both sacred and profane.
  &quot;The bread rolls and cask of riesling were co-opted, and after a few prayers
these were `consecrated' and the cosy little liturgy group partook of the
sacrament. 
  &quot;When someone questioned the proceedings, she was greeted with scornful
laughter, and her subsequent protest to the archbishop proved fruitless.&quot;

  Modernists have destroyed the church to such an extent, Gilchrist argues,
that expressing a liking for pipe organs or beautiful church interiors leaves
a person open to the charge of being a pre-Vatican II relic.
  Brisbane is described as Australia's &quot;avant garde liturgy capital&quot;, and
Banyo Seminary is singled out for &quot;academic trendiness&quot;.
  Sex education has been abused in Catholic schools in epidemic proportions,
the book contends, with secondary students being invited to talk about
&quot;horniness&quot; or confronted with questions like: Do you masturbate? What
kind of sex do you really get into? Are you a virgin?
  It relates how 13 and 15-year-old girls at two Brisbane Catholic colleges
were shown a film and warned that &quot;words like `screw' would be used and that
those with `a weak stomach' or from a `refined home' might leave the room&quot;.
  One Marist Brothers College course for Year 12 is supposed to have posed
questions like: What do poofters/lesbians do when they have sex? How do
you get a girl randy?
  What is cunnilingus? Is it dangerous?
  What does semen taste like? Does it increase your weight?
  Teachers taking the course were advised: &quot;No moralising.&quot;
  Extreme examples, perhaps, but they reinforce the book's theme - the
unwillingness or inability of bishops and other church leaders to take action
on such matters. 
  The Left-wing political pronouncements of groups like the Catholic
Commission for Justice and Peace, funded from Lenten collections for the
needy, are also examined.
  In light of trends uncovered in the work, and recent events in the US,
Australia's 3.7 million Catholics can wonder whether the Pope's visit will be
followed up by disciplinary action against dissenters.
  Already this year, one American bishop has been stripped of most of his
authority, and a dissenting theologian muzzled as part of Pope John Paul's
push to reassert traditional Catholic practices and teaching.
  Australian Catholics who believe dissent and pluralism make for a lively,
magnanimous church are alarmed at what one of the world's top Catholic
magazines, the London Tablet, reported recently under a banner headline
&quot;Church besieged, Rome bears down on American Catholics&quot;.
  The magazine pointed out that what is basically an obedient, generous
church has been singled out for correction, with imprimaturs*impramaturs
withdrawn from books, clergy investigated and disciplined almost weekly. 
  The cause, it said, was partly cultural, because &quot;for Pope John Paul,
those who suffer like the Poles make the best Catholics. Those who enjoy
the benefits of freedom and democracy (like Americans and Australians)
will always be tempted to accept secular values.&quot;
  On that basis, no wonder Ireland's Catholic population, described recently
by their leading churchman as remote, rural and poor, count themselves among
the Pope's &quot;favorites&quot;.
  When the Pope visited Ireland in 1979, 1.25 million people out of a Catholic
population of fewer than three million, attended his Dublin Mass, while
almost everyone else attended one of several Masses in the country.
  Australian Catholics keen to see a shift on constrictions like celibacy,
birth control, divorce, women priests and altar servers look set for a long
wait.
  Most of these are &quot;non-negotiable&quot;, as emphasised recently by Archbishop
John Foley, the Vatican communications chief in Rome.
  The introduction of an optional celibacy, however, could be a surprise
reform of the not-too-distant future.
  &quot;Compulsory celibacy could go tomorrow,&quot; Archbishop Foley acknowledged.
  It probably will not, he stressed, as Pope John Paul II strongly supported
it, but it is only a church discipline, not a divine law, and only introduced
in the Middle Ages.
  After all, Christ himself cured Saint Peter's mother-in-law, and the
majority of present-day Catholics believe their priests should be given
the chance to marry.
  While celibacy in theory allows priests to devote themselves fully to
all their people, Archbishop Foley admitted that the church could benefit
from the work and support of priests' wives, as do other churches.
  So far, Rome's view of Australia is best seen in a three-page pictorial
spread in the Vatican newspaper: &quot;Australia: Land of the Southern Cross.&quot;
  The piece covered Australia's history, landscape and people in depth
and its ecumenical nature.
  The high divorce rate, and the large number of &quot;merely nominal Christians&quot;
and &quot;unchurched&quot; people were mentioned.
  Next week will really show what Karol Wojtyla thinks of Australia and
Australians.
