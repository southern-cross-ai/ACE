Morals in a meltdown THEATRE A FAULT-LINE
By Luigi Pirandello, translated by Tim Fitzpatrick
With Wenanty Nosul, Daniel Mitchell, Dasha Blahova, Tracey Callander, Brandon
Burke.
Director: Richard Lawton; set: Jacqui Brown; costumes: Melody Cooper 
Downstairs Theatre, Seymour Centre. August 20  

  THIS production is being presented by Sydney University's Theatre Studies
Service Unit (all that remains of the useful Theatre Workshop) and the
Department of Italian, to honour the 50th anniversary of Pirandello's death.
  The play was the last to be completed by Pirandello. It was written in
1934, just after his Nobel Prize. This is its first production, professional
or otherwise, in Sydney. That should surprise nobody. Pirandello in Australia,
as in England and America, is the most neglected of major 20th century 
playwrights. Here even his best-known masterpiece, Six Characters in Search
Of An Author, awaits professional attention.
  For this occasion, Dr Fitzpatrick of the Italian Department, working with
the director and cast, has produced a translation that is grammatically
fluent. Pirandello's last conducted tour of his inimitable metaphysical
maze comes across with the sparkle, clarity and wit that have always
distinguished Mediterranean philosophy.
  In important ways, this last play is a departure for Pirandello. His subject,
though lavishly adorned with metaphysical paradoxes as ever, displays a
dance of life in which the compulsions of the newfangled Freudian subconscious
dominate philosophical probing. The old games of identity, appearance and
reality here employ the language of Freudian dream and guilt. We watch the
melting down of traditional codes of morals and of honour in the heat, 50
years ago, of the Freudian revolution.
  Even so, it is Pirandello who is in charge, not Freud. The character who
may be going mad in this adulterous vortex of unintended sins and imagined
infidelities does so only because he feels guilty about having no sense
of guilt. That situation is Pirandello as ever was; and so this is the way
that emotional passion, not intellectual probing, spins the plot.
  Or so it seems to me. My argument with this poised, visually attractive,
well-considered production is that the director takes his cue too literally
from the patterned advances; retreats and circlings of the argument. He
matches these with choreography, balletic or acrobatic, that tends to play
up the artificiality of the forms of action and to reduce the characters
of two mixed-up marriages, with interlocked triangles, to puppet functions.
Diagram takes over from drama.
  There are problems also with style (and with a medley of accents from
the cast). The production misses the irony that makes this play a comedy.
When laughter finally erupts, it comes from the acrobatics of farce.
  However, one must be grateful for spirited and elegant acting (especially
from Brandon Burke, stylish in decadent, aristocratic egocentrism, and Dasha
Blahova, who best suggests the irony). As well, there is Jacqui Brown's
handsome, Roman marble, porticoed set. Above all, there is the rare opportunity
to savour a fascinating play by this master dramatist.
