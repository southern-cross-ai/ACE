	<h> Peace with God &amp; world peace </h>
	


	<bl> By Rev Sir Alan Walker </bl>
	

  There cannot be peace at the circumference of life while disharmony reigns
at the centre of life. To be separated from God transmits seismic repercussions
to every level of human affairs. To become reconciled with God is to be
reconciled with everything in His world. Peace with God alone makes possible
world peace.
  To become alienated from God has enormous consequences. From separation
from God come divided, broken personalities. Inner turmoil and conflict
project themselves into human relationships creating tension and division.
Disturbed, discordant, distracted personalities operating in corporate
situations set people against people. When broken personalities achieve
positions of power, as seen in Hitler, they can become a cause of war.


	<h> Social righteousness </h>
	

  Peace is impossible without social righteousness. Righteousness means
social justice, yet goes beyond justice. It is both a gift from God and
an achievement between human beings. It links together personal salvation
and social redemption.
  Peace cannot come while half the human race lives in abject poverty. Every
shanty town in Latin America, every slum in India or Pakistan, every starving
tribe in Ethiopia, are helpless potential causes of conflict and war.
  Peace cannot come while Aborigines are denied land rights in Australia
and while 22 million Blacks in South Africa suffer under apartheid, the
vilest racism since slavery.
  Peace cannot come while women are treated with exclusion and discrimination
in the fundamentalist Islamic states of Iran, Sudan and Pakistan.
  Peace cannot come while totalitarian regimes of the &quot;left&quot; and the &quot;right&quot;
hold people in bondage, directing their thinking and restraining their
movement. 
  Peace cannot come while the United States and Soviet Union divert vast
resources which could lift the burden of world poverty, to the wasteful,
senseless, blasphemous nuclear arms race.
