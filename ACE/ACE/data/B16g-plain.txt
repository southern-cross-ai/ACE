More talk  

A HINT of desperation has crept into the Federal Government's economic
management.  First we had the rare spectacle of a Treasurer voicing fears
of Australia's becoming a banana republic.
  Then, two days after giving assurances that the tax cuts promised for
September would stand, Mr Keating leaves open a possibility that they may
be deferred to save revenue.
  And now we are told there is to be yet another summit-style talkfest to
decide future economic directions.
  The overall impression is of a Government that is formulating economic
policy on the run. Where is the political leadership that Australia needs?
