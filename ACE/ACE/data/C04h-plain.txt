LIFE'S DOSE OF MEDICINE TV today  

IT'S 1957. Celia and Jessica are two pretty flatmates and their lives are
just starting.
  Jessica wants a rich husband, Celia a career.
  And their story is told in Strong Medicine which premieres tonight on
Channel 10 at 8.30, with Part Two shown tomorrow.
 Based on Arthur Hailey's best-seller, the two-part mini-series follows
the girls' adventures from their apartment-sharing days to husbands, the
hippy 60s and middle age. Pamela Sue Martin plays Celia Grey, an ambitious
young woman who would rather stay up late studying than go on a date.
