WHAT POLLIES REALLY THINK  

POLITICIANS and bureaucrats beware.
  Psychologists can now read behind the rhetorical statement.
  The political rhetoric of world leaders is providing American psychologist
Dr Philip Tetlock with an accurate indicator of what politicians really
think about important issues.
  For example, the soft-line literary use of language currently shown by
the Soviet leader, Mr Gorbachev, tells him that Mr Gorbachev would be
prepared to reach a major agreement with the US.
  But Dr Tetlock has found the current US administration more sceptical
in outlook than any administration in the last 12 years.
