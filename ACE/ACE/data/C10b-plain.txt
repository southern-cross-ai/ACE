Book blasts royal family  

LONDON: The most controversial and critical book on the royal family yet
published went on sale in Britain yesterday.
  The book Our Own Dear Queen blasts the Queen as being "po-faced" and Prince
Philip as having "the brains of a polo pony".
  Republican author Piers Brendon also attacks Princess Margaret as an
alcoholic and accuses Prince Charles of being a "cradle snatcher", according
to a report in the Sunday People newspaper.
  He claims Princess Margaret has done for royalty what John McEnroe has
done for tennis.
  He refers to rumors of drunken squabbles, her compulsive infidelities
and squalid post-marital escapades.
  Buckingham Palace has refused to comment.
