                E.  Background

                F.  List of tables A.  HOW TO USE THIS BOOK  

        Have you ever wondered how many Australians pray and how often?
Have you wondered if church attendance makes any difference in the
attitudes Australians hold about various matters? What percentage of
Australians do you think consider themselves religious people? Does this
make any difference in other parts of their lives? Are "religious" people
different from "non-religious" people? Do Catholics have different attitudes
from Anglicans, or are the religious groups pretty much the same?

        How often have you had a discussion around questions like these
and wanted "the facts"? There is a lot of opinion about the role of religion
in Australian life. Bruce Wilson (1983) and David Millikan (1981) argue
that Australia is a secular society with a dwindling minority of religious
people. Is this correct? For a quick answer look at the major findings
(starting on the next page).

        This book makes data relevant to such questions as these available.
It is a source book of research findings about the role of religion in
Australian life. The purpose is to make the results of the Australian Values
Systems Study handy for use. With these data in hand, the reader can ask
and answer his or her own questions. For example, "Does church attendance
make a difference in family life?" Yes (see Chapter VII for details on how).

        This book will not stop the debate about the role of religion in
Australian society. It should lift the debate by increasing the information
on the subject. As a result there is a great deal of data presented, too
much to digest in one sitting. That is not the point. Start by looking up
a topic that interests you.

        This book does not draw out all of the implications of the findings.
Rather it is the beginning of a process which will involve many people who,
in examining these data from their own vantage points will raise different
questions and draw different conclusions. You are invited to be part of
the process of interpretation and application of these data.

 B.  WHO WILL WANT TO USE THIS BOOK?  

        Who will want to use this book? Policy makers, both religious and
secular may find these data useful in forming a correct picture of the role
of religion and the future of the church. Church leaders, including both
clergy and laity may find information related to their ministry, evangelism
or church policy questions. Students of religion and society may want to
use these data in their analyses. Anyone interested in the role religion
plays in the way Australians think will find this book interesting and thought
provoking.

 C.  MAJOR FINDINGS  

        There is a large amount of detail in this book. The following list
of major findings is a sensitizing guide to the data. Following each "finding"
will be an indication of the location of the evidence supporting the "finding".
This list also acts as a highlighted summary of the study.
                           
 a.  Australia is More Religious Than Many Think  

        It cannot be said that Australia is essentially secular and irreligious
when:

1.      57.9% of Australians claim to be religious persons and only 4.5%
        claim to be atheists (Table I.V.3.a).

2.      57.4% of Australians rate the importance of God in their lives as
        6 or more on a scale of 1-10. Only 13.7% rated God as 1 (not at
        all important).

3.      85.6% of Australians identify with some religious group.

4.      Two-thirds of Australians pray, meditate or contemplate occasionally
        or more frequently (Table I.B.2.a).

5.      27.1% of Australians claim to go to church once per month or more
        frequently. 20.6% claim to go weekly (Table I.B.1.b).

6.      Nearly half of those who claim to have no religion, pray, meditate
        or contemplate occasionally or more frequently (Table I.B.2.b).

 b.  Denominational Identification Makes a Difference in Australian Society  

        The five groups of religious identification - Catholic, Anglican,
PMU (Presbyterian, Methodist and Uniting), RWP (theologically Right Wing
Protestant groups) and "Nones" (those who identify with no religious group)
- are found to differ from each other both in terms of religiosity and
non-religious attitudes. Denominational identification makes a difference
in Australian society.

1.      The RWP group is the most religious followed in order by the Catholics,
        the PMU group, Anglicans and the "Nones" (Chapter 1).

2.      Those who claim to have no religion are the most likely to object to a
        list of groups of people as neighbours. They are the least tolerant.
        The RWP group (conservative protestant) are the least likely to
        object. They are the most tolerant of these groups (Table V.A.1.a).
        It cannot be said that those who are religious are less tolerant
        of sub-groups in Australian society. In fact the opposite is the
        case.

3.      Conservative religious groups are not necessarily conservative
        politically (Table IV.C.1.b).

4.      Anglicans are the most willing to sacrifice for Australia and most
        committed to the monarchy. The PMU group are the proudest to be
        Australian (Table VI.B.1.b).

5.      In eight out of ten social issues measured denominational
        identification makes an appreciable difference (Chapter VI).

6.      Denominational identification is related to pronounced differences
        in attitudes toward family. Catholics and the RWP group were the
        most pro-family, least likely to approve of abortion or divorce.
        The "Nones" were the least supportive of family and least likely
        to object to divorce or abortion (Chapter VII).
 
7.      The "Nones" tend to be more hedonistic than those identifying with
        some religious group. But there are differences among the religious
        groups as well. The RWP group tends to be the most strict on moral
        issues (see Chapter VIII for specific differences).
                                            
 c.  Degree of Religiosity Makes a Difference in Australian Society  

1.      Those who think of God in "personal" terms pray much more frequently
        than do those who think of God as a "life force/spirit" (Table
        II.B.1.a).

2.      Those who are more religious have a slight tendency to favour more
        conservative political parties (Table III.A.2.a).

3.      Those who are more religious are more pro-Australian and pro-monarchy
        than are the less religious (Table IV.B.1.c). See Chapter IV for
        more detailed analyses.

4.      Those who are more religious are more open to the idea of having
        persons of a different race as neighbours (Table V.B.2.b). See Chapter
        V for more detailed analyses.

5.      Degree of religiosity makes an appreciable difference in 7 of the
        10 social issues analysed. The more religious are more likely to
        consider the pace of change too fast (VI.A.2.a), are more inclined
        toward international altruism (VI.B.2.a), are more likely to think
        too much is spent on the environment (VI.B.2.a), are more opposed
        to the use and legalization of drugs (VI.C.2.c) and less likely
        to report that they drank alcohol (VI.C.3.b). See Chapter VI for
        more detailed analyses.

6.      The data show an interesting relationship between religiosity and
        family. The more religious are more likely to be married (once)
        and least likely to have lived in a de facto relationship (VII.A.2.c),
        less likely to consider marriage to be outdated (VII.A.1.c), more
        likely to have children (VII.A.3.b), slightly more likely to think
        "a woman's place is in the home" (VII.B.1.c), less likely to approve
        of abortion (VII.C.1.c), less likely to approve of free sex, single
        mothers and in vitro fertilization procedures (VII.D.2.a and
        VII.D.2.b), and less likely to approve of divorce (VII.E.2.a). See
        Chapter VII for further detailed analyses.

7.      Finally, the data show an interesting relationship between religiosity
        and moral issues. The more religious are more likely to take a
        traditional, conservative, pro-family stance on moral issues. See
        Chapter VIII for detailed analyses.

        Australia is not a secular society with just a few religious people
on the fringes. Further, denomination and degree of religiosity do make
a difference in the attitudes and values of Australians. These facts contradict
commonly held ideas that religion is irrelevant and of little importance
to public policy and public life in Australia. The next section addresses
some of these implications.
                      
 D.  SOME IMPLICATIONS OF THESE FINDINGS  

        Four people were asked to write a brief reaction to the data in
this book. These reactions will sensitize readers to possible implications
of this study for several aspects of Christian ministry and witness in
Australia.

           Implications for the Purpose and Strategy of Churches  

        The study suggests some fundamental issues about the purpose of
        churches and the strategies they adopt to achieve those purposes.

        1.   Some of the data are so contrary to conventional Australian
             platitudes that further exploration of the issues is essential.
             For example, those who for decades have complained of, or exulted
             in, our "secular" society where "religious" understanding is
             unimportant and/or declining apparently now have cause for
             reflection. That particular battle largely has been misplaced.

             Ways of discussing and measuring "religiosity" that are grounded
             within our society need to be developed rather than using terms
             and measures that do not fully "connect", or may mean different
             things to different people.

        2.   45% of people who understand themselves as "religious" do not
             or only rarely attend church. 15% of people who do not see
             themselves as "religious" attend church occasionally or regularly.

             Looking backwards, have basic goals for some churches been
             displaced to the extent that such churches have become only
             incidentally "religious"? Possibly other objectives such as
             the search for institutional strength and extension have become
             primary in such cases.

             Looking forwards, there may be scope for numerous entrepreneurial
             options in seeking to express more vigorously and clearly
             Christian approaches that relate more closely to underlying
             life concerns and experiences.
        
        3.   "Religious" people are found to be more tolerant of the
             disadvantaged and less tolerant of the deviant than
             "non-religious" people, although there are complexities in
             the detailed data.

             Churches that seek to follow a person described as a friend
             of outcasts and sinners have an opportunity to exercise a far
             stronger accepting, reconciling and healing role in our society.

                    Implications for Educational Programmes   

                This book presents several challenges to those in the church
        involved in Christian leadership training, preaching, religious
        instruction, theological education or any form of Christian marketing:
        
        1.  There is something seriously wrong with existing programmes
            if 27% of the sample are regular church-goers yet 58% regard
            themselves as religious (alienating language, rituals and
            structures?).

        2.  The fact that 58% of the "Nones" (no religion) said they believed
            in a personal God/spirit or life force, suggests that there
            is a ready market for the Christian religion, if only its advocates
            and leaders learned fundamental skills of communication.

        3.  If the gospel of the Kingdom has impact on social life, then
            it is disturbing that "the most interest in politics was expressed
            by the least religious and the atheists" (p. 37). If the
            socio-political implications of the gospel are not addressed
            in pulpits, seminaries, Sunday Schools, small groups and RI
            classes, how are Christians to be equipped as agents of social
            transformation? Forms of Christian education that produce
            socio-political quietism need to be abandoned and replaced by
            those that promote critical reflection and transforming action
            in an unjust world. It is embarrassing that the greatest level
            of dissatisfaction about the way Aborigines have been treated
            occurs in the "Nones" group (36% cf. PMU - 17%) )p. 47f).

        4.  If security and family life are the "most highly ranked life
            goals" for Australians (p. 152), one can only deduce that 73%
            of Australians identify most of what goes on inside church as
            marginal to their interests. Yet clearly these two themes are
            central to the Christian religion. Perhaps the "market" could
            be recaptured if evangelism and instruction were set much more
            in the context of the home and local community, informal
            relationships, dialogue, inquiry and intelligible language.

                               Implications for Pastoral Care  

        There is a host of pastorally-relevant information within this study. I would like here simply to point to two or three issues which I believe have major implicaitons for pastoral strategy.
