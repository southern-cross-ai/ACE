Sexy Tina to boogie with little Princes. LONDON:  

 Prince William and his baby brother Harry are to have a special
private dance teacher ...
...rock'n'roll's sexiest grandmother, Tina Turner.
  The unprecedented Royal invitation from Prince Charles followed a back-stage
meeting where, Tina says, Charles told her she had the best legs he had seen.
  "I was completely flabbergasted," she said.
  Tina, 46, the powerhouse singer who taught Mick Jagger to dance, met Charles
and Di after a concert in London.
  "They sent me a lovely picture of their boys playing in the garden," she
said.
  "But there was also a letter from Charles.
  "It suggested I should get along to the palace and help Diana give little
William and Henry some dancing lessons.
  "I was utterly bowled over - but totally thrilled.
  "So I wrote back a note saying: "Thank you, Sir - I'll get your boys to
boogie.'
  The living room of my home in Los Angeles if full of gold discs, music
awards and Grammy statuettes - but that picture of the little Princess is
in pride of place on my main wall.
  "I'm sure Diana is doing a fantastic job herself teaching the boys - I
felt she had such style and grace when I met her." 
  Tina, who had a smash hit with the record, Private Dancer, said the night
of the star-studded Prince's trust show was incredible.
  I'd just sung Let It Be with Paul McCartney live on stage in front of
thousands of fans, including some of the Royal family, and I honestly thought
that was going to be the biggest thrill of my life," she said.
  "I've always admired Paul and when he came up to me backstage and asked
if I'd sing on stage with him I was delighted.
  "We used old Beatles numbers a lot in the Ike and Tina Turner revue so I
knew the words by heart.
  "But just an hour later I found myself chatting away to Prince Charles
and his lovely wife as if we were old friends."
