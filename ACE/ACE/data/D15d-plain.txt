Friday August 8 AN UNDYING FLAME PRAY  
Lord, may I see the light of your purity, the fire of your cleansing
       and the flame of your love ever before me.

 READ  
Leviticus 6:8-13.

 THINK  
The first and last thing an Israelite would have seen each day was
the smoke of the burnt offering rising from the court of the Tabernacle.
  Why do you think the fire was kept constantly burning (12,13)?

  Because people constantly sin, God made provision for their continual
need for atonement in the burnt offering always burning on the altar. The
flame and the smoke would serve as an ever-present reminder of both their
need and God's provision of a way of forgiveness.
  We have no column of smoke to remind us. But we do have the undying flame
of his love which sent Jesus to die once for ever for our sins. And 'he
always lives to intercede for us' (Hebrews 7:25, NIV).

 NOTE  
The quarantine-like precautions in verses 10 and 11. In fact, that
is exactly what they are. Why?
  God is holy, and anything consecrated for his service (including any part
of the sacrifice - even the ashes) becomes holy. Holiness cannot co-exist
with uncleanness, so if any uncleanness comes in contact with anything holy
judgement falls. The priest may not wear his holy uniform outside the camp
(where it is unclean) lest he bring judgement upon himself and the people.
Furthermore, the holy ashes must not be dumped just anywhere outside the
camp; they have to be taken to a clean place (11).
  Jesus too was concerned about the contamination of sin.
  What did he see was the way for his followers to be kept holy (John
17:14-19)?

 PRAISE  
Thank God that at any time you may confess your sin and be freely
forgiven for Jesus' sake. Thank him too for Jesus' continuing intercession
for us.

 PRAY  
Pray for your pastor Like the priest of Israel, he needs to remember
people's basic need - forgiveness.
