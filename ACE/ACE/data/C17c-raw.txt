  THE Gilbert and Sullivan Society of WA has chosen Iolanthe as its
presentation this year.
  The brilliant satire of Gilbert's libretto and Sullivan's lively and tuneful
music, will open at His Majesty's Theatre on Thursday, August 21. It should
provide a bright entertainment.
  It was the first of the pair's operas to be presented at the Savoy Theatre,
built especially by Richard D'Oyly Carte to stage their works when they
were growing in popularity.
  Pamela Turner will be in the title role. The Lord Chancellor will be Ross
Bryant; the Earl of Ararat, John Harrison; Earl Tolloller, Frank Lazzari;
Constable Willis, Owen McClements; Strethon the shepherd, John Kessey; Queen
of the Fairies, Lorraine Kirwan-Doesburg; and Phyllis the shepherdess, Allison
Fyfe.
