	<h> British aglow with pride </h>

THE British film industry is aglow with pride this week after having won
the top award at Cannes for the spectacular film &quot;The Mission&quot;.
  The prize virtually means survival for the Goldcrest company which had
a massive flop last year with its $28 million historical epic &quot;Revolution&quot;.
  Apart from its artistic merit, &quot;The Mission&quot; is expected to be a commercial
blockbuster; all Goldcrest's remaining hopes of survival rested on its
performance at Cannes.
  Remarkably, the film was not really finished before it was rushed before
the jury and now it goes back for further editing and polishing.
  &quot;The Mission,&quot; starring Robert de Niro and Jeremy Irons, is about Jesuits
sent by the Pope to work among Indians in South America and the political
and moral conflicts that arise between them.
  It was a double triumph for Britain. Bob Hoskins collected the best actor
award for his part as a timid gangster in &quot;Mona Lisa.&quot;
  It was the first time in 13 years that a British film had taken the coveted
Golden Palm award and the first time in 20 years that a Briton had been
named best actor.
