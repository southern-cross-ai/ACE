	<h> Drug judge report shakes NSW Govt </h>
	

  THE State Government was rocked today by a potentially new scandal over
the sentences handed out to drug offenders by a NSW judge.
  While the Opposition called for a judicial inquiry, Attorney-General
Mr Sheahan admitted that if suggestions made about the judge were proved
correct it would amount to &quot;a monstrous perversion of justice&quot;.
  The row was triggered by the findings of a study of the NSW legal system,
which was funded by the Australian Criminology Research Council.
  According to the report, which was leaked to The Sydney Morning Herald,
a NSW District Court judge appeared to have exercised selective leniency
in dealing with defendants represented by a particular solicitor.
