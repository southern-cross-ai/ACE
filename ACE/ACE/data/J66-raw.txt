	<h> Loss and reassurance: Beverley Farmer's fiction </h>
	


	<bl> By Cassandra Pybus </bl>
	

In her most poignant story, &quot;Summer on Ice&quot; Beverley Farmer interpolates
into the narrative a quote from DG Rosetti:
  &quot;Look in my face; my name is Might-Have-Been.
  I am also called No-more, Too Late, Farewell ...&quot;
                                           
	<misc>(Milk, p 132) </misc>
	

While beautifully apposite to the circumstance of that story, these lines
could also be read as a poetic encapsulation of Farmer's work as a whole.
Alberto Moravia once said that writers have this one big theme they repeat
over and over. On the strength of Farmer's work to date, Moravia's observation
would certainly hold true. She is a writer who has chosen to explore the
internal realm of individual emotion, and within that territory her persistent
theme is the experience of loss. Each of Farmer's stories concern loss in
some form. The experience may be brutal and complete, but more often it
is subtle and intangible, though as inexorable as the passage of time.
  In &quot;Summer on Ice&quot; Caro ultimately experiences a specific loss in the
termination of her affair with a married man, but throughout the story is
suffused with her sense of evanescence of life itself:

  Caroline, who has been so sure that certain afternoons were really
  unforgettable, finds they have gone. Like a film only intermittently in
  focus, all the rest a mist. In dreams she relives moments and wakes burning
  and overjoyed. The dreams fade quickly. 
	<misc>(Milk, p 132) </misc>
	

As ephemeral as the shimmering ice on which she longs to glide and whirl,
Caro's love affair appears both to herself and the reader as a mirage:

  There are days when Caro does feel as if she is living a dream. She is
  not real; or she is fading, becoming invisible; or is left behind by time.
  She lies awake all night. No one knows that they are - were? - lovers.
  Are we? Were we? she wonders. 
	<misc>(Milk, p 128)</misc>
	

His cavalier dismissal confirms her perception of the inevitability of her
loss, which is as much a function of time as it is the vagaries of human
emotion. Something of the same sense is contained in &quot;At the Airport&quot;, another
of Farmer's excruciating and beautiful stories, in which a mother waits
for her son's return from a three months stay in Greece with her ex-husband.
Throughout her vigil she is assailed by the loss of her marriage and family,
and her fear of the ultimate loss of her son. At their reunion, compounded
loss and emotion overwhelm her:
  
  To her ex-husband she says in Greek, &quot;There are times when -&quot; She can't
  speak. &quot;Life -&quot; she tries again. &quot;Oh, life. Life. Well, yes.&quot; He smiles
  wanly. The trees toss and swill the gold light. Their eyes glitter with
  it.

  In the story &quot;Woman in a Mirror&quot;, a woman contemplating her body fears
cancer of the cervix growing within it. &quot;Could death and decay be growing
where the child grew she wonders, so soon after?&quot; (Milk p 163) The story
concerns death; the death of her husband during her pregnancy on holiday
in Yugoslavia; and her own impending death, be it sooner or later. &quot;Everything
deteriorates,&quot; she thinks. &quot;Nothing lasts. Flesh and love, memories,
relationships, the will to live.&quot; (Milk, p 166)
  
  Death, the ultimate loss, is an omnipresent force in both collections
of Farmer's work, Milk (1983) and Home Times (1985), as it is the raison
d'etre for the earlier novel Alone (1981). &quot;I am bloody, bold and resolute,&quot;
Shirley tells us on the opening page of Alone. &quot;I am golden in the dark.
This is my dying day&quot; (Alone, p 1) And though we are spared suicidal details
in the novel, the stories contain recurring images of death, stark and shocking
in their preciseness. Yet, for all the stunning impact of these images,
it is death as a presence, rather than actuality, which is most powerful
in Farmer's work. She has an acute awareness of the poignancy, and the terror,
of mortality, as well as its insistence. This is especially the case with
the first collection Milk which carries an epigraph from Greek author Stratis
Myrivilis that Farmer has translated as: &quot;All of us are passing through,
no matter where we go ...&quot;
  The first and title story concerns a small boy's growth into the knowledge
of mortality and the harsh demands of natural cycles. On his holidays in
Greece, Niko cannot accept the cruel village convention that would starve
a baby donkey rather than spare precious winter feed. He braves ridicule
to keep the donkey alive, just as, in parallel, his Greek grandmother smuggles
yogurt to the dying neighbour in the belief it will make her better. But
the cancer inevitably kills the neighbour and Niko must return to Australia
and leave the donkey to its fate. &quot;What can we do?&quot; Grandmother explains.
&quot;It has to be so. We all have to die. We die and donkeys die, even wolves
die.&quot; (Milk, p 14) If Niko remains adamant in his rejection of this code,
other children in Farmer's work come to the knowledge of mortality more
readily. Paul, in &quot;At the Airport&quot; understands about his grandmother's death.
&quot;He knows he will die one day. He buries birds and chickens, and saves moths
from his cat.&quot; (Milk, p 64) Such acceptance comes more readily to the children
than to many of Farmer's adult characters who fear death and disintegration,
even as they recognize it is their constant companion. Knowledge does not
necessarily bring with it acceptance or submission.
  Accompanying Farmer's concern with time and the loss that the passing
of time brings, is an intense feeling of separateness and isolation. Bell,
in &quot;Place of Birth&quot;, takes photos of the Greek home she shares with her
Greek inlaws. When she leaves, against her husband's wishes, to return to
Australia, she will take these with her: &quot;Bare interiors of sun and shade
and firelight, in which she always appears absent.&quot; (Home Time, p 25) In
&quot;White Friday&quot;, Barbara, returned to Greece, wakes from a dream of death
to an awareness of herself as &quot;a void, a vortex&quot;. Alone in Thessaloniki
another Australian in &quot;St Kay's Day&quot; appraises her somewhat pathetic life
and concludes that, &quot;Wherever in the world she was at Christmas she would
be among strangers&quot;. (Milk, p 54) In all these stories, the sense of
separateness is underscored by the individual's alienation from the established
culture in which they find themselves. However, the Greek-Australian conflict
of values and culture, which forms the basis of so many of Farmer's stories,
is not so much an exploration of social consciousness as a dramatized and
externalized aspect of the profound sense of otherness possessed by most
of her characters. In Alone Shirley gives this description of herself: &quot;...
a snooper on foot now, much given to peering in at inhabited windows and
doorways. I have always been outside, an onlooker&quot;. 
	<misc>(Alone, p 26)</misc>
	

  All Farmer's characters are essentially alone. Where they are seen in
relationship to another it is usually to illuminate their separateness and
loneliness. There are occasional, exquisite glimpses of the unity of parent
and child, usually fleeting memories of a time that is lost and of emotions
which are no longer comprehensible. For Dimitri, the middle-aged son of
Melpo, vivid memories of his youthful mother, now truculent and dying, bind
him to a past that is lost and irrecoverable. In &quot;At the Airport&quot;, a waiting
mother relives in memory the last occasion of real togetherness with her
son:

  She remembers their summer beaches. She dwells on the time when he was
  four, only four, and they were in Greece for the last time together. She
  blew up his yellow floaties on his arms, took his hand and swam with him
  in tow far out into the deep water where a yacht was anchored. Puffing,
  they clung to a buoy rope that threw bubbles of water in a chain on the
  surface of the sea. Scared and proud, they waved to his father and the
  rest of the family, those dots on the sand, aunts and uncles and cousins.
  The yacht tilted creaking above them. On the sea, as if in thick glass,
  its mast wobbled among clouds. They glided back hand in hand. Used to
  waters where sharks might be, she had never dared swim out so far before.
  Here there were none. They passed, mother and son, above mauve skeins
  of jellyfish suspended where the water darkened, but no one touched them.
  Bubbles had clustered, she saw, on the fine silver hairs on his back,
  on his brown legs and arms and on hers.

  She often dreams of this swim now. It was a month after it, back home
  in the early spring, that she left home. 
	<misc>(Milk, p 58)</misc>
	

The special intimacy of mother and child is celebrated in lyrical memory;
it is not a sustained or sustaining unity of feeling. Many more episodes
illuminate the emotional breach which develops between parent and child
in the process of individuation and separation.
  Adult characters are quite unable to provide succour or emotional sustenance,
however much they may cleave to each other. Indeed, it is often precisely
at those moments of intimacy and close familiar contact that the perception
of being separate is most keen. Lovers, too, are strangers, invariably
entangled in misapprehensions and resentments. In &quot;White Friday&quot; Barbara
longs for the man she loves in Australia, yet in her thoughts of him pleasure
is mingled with trepidation:

  Naked in her white bed she imagines herself in his. She strokes his arms
  and shoulders, strokes him all over and kisses his shaggy head as it bends
  to her nipple. He has long eyelashes like shadows. The dark hairs of his
  body press soft against her. When he falls asleep he lies breathing in
  her arms, as confiding as a child (as his children). But he is lent, not
  given. He has said - to her, to others - that he can never imagine living
  with her. He asked once, &quot;If you had a man, would you want to have another
  child?&quot; The words spread silently inside her like blood pooling. How should
  she have answered? What does it mean anyway - have?
     Why did he ask? 
	<misc>(Home Time, p 90)</misc>
	

She writes to him her innermost secrets in a letter she will not send him:

  Letters never sent, or sent but not answered; if answered, not answered
  to the point but at an angle to it: this is how it has been with him all
  along, in spite of what they wanted. She suspects that it will be in silence
  that they lose each other, by which time he won't care. 
	<misc>(Home Time, p
  86) </misc>
	

  That lovers will lose each other is inevitable in Farmer's universe where
passion is transient, love a chimera, and even life itself seems ephemeral.
It is an immensely painful vision, and pain figures largely in the experience
of her characters. Pain is as ineluctable as the process of time, it is
the very stuff of life. Farmer closes her latest collection with an observation
of a Greek grandmother, Sophia: &quot;Pain is like salt in a way ... it can make
the sweetness stronger, unless there is too much of it&quot;. (Home Time, p 203)
In some stories there is too much pain, as in &quot;Fire and Flood&quot;, Home Time,
in which a man loses first his stepson, then his wife in twin disasters.
Totally numbed by this experience he wishes &quot;to remain suspended out of
life, of time, beyond all possibilities of action&quot;. (Home Time, p 123).
A similar desire for annihilation besets Shirley*Shirely in Alone, though
the more common response is akin to that of Sophia. If Farmer's characters
are assailed by loss, by grief, by pain, they also gain strength and resilience
through their knowledge of it.

  A number of reviewers have commented, with censure, on what they see as
passivity in Farmer's women. They report a desire to shake some resistance
into them.
