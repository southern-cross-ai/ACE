	<h> Howard's wife stands by him </h>

 As the supposed hordes of Peacock supporters close in on the
Opposition Leader, Mr John Howard, and the hounds of the media smell a
Liberal leadership challenge, you can count on one thing.
  Janette Howard will be in there, standing right beside her man.
  There is no other phrase for it:  Mrs Howard is an oldfashioned,
straightdown-the-line wife to her life mate.
  And although she sat through the same philosophy lectures*lecturers as 1960s
notable rebel student, Mr Richard Neville, there is no feeling of her ever 
having been a student radical.
  When you look at the record of Janette Parker, to give Mrs Howard her
maiden name, the feeling gets stronger.
  She was also a Master of Arts student in Australian literature and she
was always a staunch Liberal, with a big &quot;L&quot;.
  As Miss Parker, she &quot;had the experience of being the only person (in that
philosophy class) who put my hand up to say that I believed in God&quot;.
  &quot;The lecturer talked about `Miss Parker's God' all year,&quot; Mrs Howard recalls.
  &quot;I might add that I have met that lecturer in later years and he has
apologised.&quot;
  Sitting in her husband's office in Canberra, Mrs Howard is now talking
real uppermiddle-class politics as she sips coffee from a heavy china cup
stamped with the Australian Coat of Arms.
  &quot;John says I am getting more conservative as I get older.
  &quot;He and I have some of our biggest arguments over conservative social
issues.
  &quot;For instance, I would hang people and John would never hang people,&quot;
she says.
  &quot;We have argued for hours over that.  I think we both know the arguments
backwards.
  &quot;Oh yes, yes of course.  But that's our version of marriage.
  &quot;I mean most of the political wives do.  They wouldn't be there if they
weren't interested.
  &quot;I mean the very first thing that attracted me about John was something
I heard across the room and I thought, `I have got to go over and talk to
that fellow'.
  &quot;We first met at a political meeting.&quot;
  But as a university-educated, politically-aware person, there must be
some regrets she is sitting in her husband's office while he is out on the
floor of the chamber running a censure motion on the Hawke Government's
handling of the economy.
  &quot;No, because ... when I first met John, one of the things that I understood
about him was that he was a far better politician than I would ever make.&quot;
  Why?
  &quot;Because he has an evener keel than I do.  I mean I fly up about things
then I think about them and change.  John has a far evener quality.  He
has qualities that I couldn't match.&quot;
  One pet subject she &quot;can talk about for hours&quot; is education.
  Mrs Howard, with an Arts degree from NSW University, has taught at various
high schools.
  She has also taught at the co-educational school of Killarney Heights
in Sydney's northern suburbs.
  The experience changed her mind about the value of co-educational schools.
  &quot;I just feel that girls and boys who are at the age say 12 to 15 are at
very, very different stages of development.&quot;
  Did she ever dream she would one day be sitting in the Opposition Leader's
office?
  &quot;Well, for one thing back then, I would have thought that was the Labor
Party, because when I was at the university, the Liberal Party was still
in Government and I was sufficiently pig-headed enough to think they would
never leave.&quot;
