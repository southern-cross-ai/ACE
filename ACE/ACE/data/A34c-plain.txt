Coal trade relies on kamikaze By Brian Robins  

JAPAN'S coal traders like to refer to it as the "kamikaze" that will protect
the Australian coal industry from the worst of the shake-out from falling
demand in Japan:  "kamikaze" - divine wind - being the impact of sanctions
on South African coal exports.
  Few countries have refused to buy South African coal, although Japan's
powerful Ministry of International Trade and Industry recently told Japanese
users of South African coal that next year's purchases had to be held at
this year's level.
  MITI's decision follows the recent success of the Democrats in the US mid-term
elections.  The Japanese Government believes that with the Democrats in control
of the US Senate there will be an increase in sanctions against South Africa.
To avoid criticism of Japan, MITI decided to act.
  Japan's demand for coal will fall substantially in the medium term.  This
change is being exacerbated in the short term by sharp price falls - about
$US4 a tonne for coking coal and as much as $US5 a tonne for steaming coal
in the Japanese market.
  For some high-cost Australian producers closures are inevitable. 
  In private, senior members of Japan's steel mills have made it clear they
do not intend abiding by MITI pressure to continue to maintain purchases
of US coal.
  The outlook for some marginal Australian producers is bleak.
  Most Australian coal producers are among the lowest-cost producers in
the world, but even then few can compete against South African coal in export
markets because of its lower cost structure and lower exchange rate for
the South African against the US dollar.
  In any event, the severe recession being felt by Japan's steel producers
is being used to maximum effect in forcing some long-term suppliers out
of the Japanese market no matter what contractual commitments are in place.
