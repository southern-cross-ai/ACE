Plan to cut airport fire services criticised By TONY HARRINGTON, transport reporter  

Pilot training by East-West Airlines could be seriously affected if the
Department of Aviation closes the airport fire service at Tamworth in New
South Wales.
  East-West trains up to 300 pilots each year at Tamworth, its home base.
 The Australian Federation of Air Pilots does not allow flying training
at airports which have no fire cover.
  The department wants to close airport fire stations at Tamworth, Norfolk
Island and Proserpine, in north Queensland, because the number of passengers
on scheduled flights has fallen below 150,000 a year, the base figure for
fire cover.                                       
  Airlines also are required to pay for "after hours" fire cover at Sydney,
Brisbane, Adelaide, Hobart, Launceston and Mount Isa airports as part of
the department's cost recovery program.
  The Federal Firefighters Union and the Australian Flight Attendants
Association have also criticised the decision to close the fire stations.
  Both unions claimed that the Department of Aviation used 1984 passenger
figures to justify decisions to close the three airport fire services.
  They have written to the department, the Government and other politicians
urging a review of the decision.
