Formulating the future  

  Many would like to see the Antarctic set aside, one way or another, as
a continent free from development or exploitation of any kind.
  Humanity's history of discovery, exploration and eventual exploitation
has seen waves of people move from their native land to inhabit what were
for a long time seen as uninhabitable regions. Two hundred years ago, white
man moved into Australia shortly after moving into southern Africa. We
are now showing signs of moving into space, the deep sea and Antartica.
  What are the possible resources available in Antartica? Although little
hope of exploitation exists realistically in the near future, some
possibilities do exist in the medium to long-term future, particularly fisheries
(being tentatively developed now), ice (as a water source), minerals
(including hydrocarbons), tourism and what I term serendipity - the unexpected
results of research.
  In discussing the future it is also worth considering the impact on
Antarctica of mankind's activities elsewhere on the globe.

 Ice as a Water Source  

  Antarctica contains 25-30 million cubic kilometres of ice, enough to raise
the sea level by some 70 metres should it melt. It sheds some 12,000-14,000
cubic kilometres per year as icebergs, with a water purity far in excess
of normal distilled water.
  There has been much popular speculation about the potential role of icebergs
as a water source, most centring on the concept of towing icebergs to the
site of water need.
  A 30 million tonne iceberg is at the larger end of the medium-sized iceberg
range and contains about .04 cubic kilometres of ice, enough water to serve the
needs of a city the size of Perth for seven to eight weeks in summer. That
amount of water is worth some $14-15 million in Perth or $18 million in
Adelaide. Both cities perceive a need for additional water for both water
supply and quality control.
