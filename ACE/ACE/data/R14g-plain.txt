Travelling Man  

  As youngsters, we lived for many years along the Mannus Creek, on our
property "Kalua". There were a number of sad occasions during these years,
but luckily the fun and thrills outnumbered these.

  During the 1940's the Forestry Commission built some huts for their workmen.
These were situated about half a mile upstream from our home and roughly
a hundred yards from the bank of the creek.

  To get across the creek the men used a raft which consisted of three
x 44 gallon drums wired together. This was attached by a wire to a cable
which was firmly secured to a solid post on either side of the creek.

 On one occasion the creek was flooded, and too dangerous to enter, even
on a strong swimming horse.

  One of the workmen, Les Henderson had to raft across to handle a chore
of some kind on the opposite side. About half way across, the wire holding
the raft to the cable broke and away went Les on the raft.

  There were a couple of blokes running along the edge of the creek, yelling
instructions to Les, while another ran back to the camp for a rope; but
it was only a few minutes before Les disappeared around a bend in the creek
and on his way into big trouble.

  A few hundred yards further downstream was a tunnel, where the water
turned really rough, creating whirl pools and charging amongst rocks into
much lower country.

  Another chap, walking along the creek, spotted this strange outfit, and
as Les got a little closer, despite his fears, he didn't lose his sense
of humour, for he called out as he went by, "Is this the way to Mildura?"

  However, the current tossed Les and the raft out of the main stream into
shallow water and Les got out soaking wet, but laughing away in his usual
manner.
