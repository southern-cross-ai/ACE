Chance to be PM slips by  

Time and the drover's dog appear to have overtaken Bill Hayden's ambition
of becoming Prime Minister.
  Mr Hayden conceded on Budget day last week his opportunity seemed to have
been lost.
  Asked if his decision to stay in Parliament meant he was waiting to become
Prime Minister at another time, Mr Hayden settled deeper into his chair
and sighed: "Aah, no.  The grim reaper of time has started to creep up on
me from behind."
  The 53-year-old former Queensland policeman earlier had said his 25 years
in Parliament represented a lifetime career. 
  Unlike Treasurer Paul Keating, who has indicated his intention to leave
politics if the Government loses the next election, Mr Hayden said he
would stay if Labor was cast back to the Opposition benches.  
  But he did not see present Opposition Leader John Howard reaching the
prime ministership.
 "I find John Howard as the Cabbage Patch kid of Australian politics," he
said.
  "He is not to be seriously perceived as Prime Minister."
  Mr Hayden was dumped from the Labor leadership just before the 1983 election
after a successful push by Mr Hawke.
  He later congratulated the new Prime Minister by saying a drover's dog
could have won that election.
  He said this week he was now impressed by the  Government's two key
personalities - Bob Hawke and Paul Keating.
  "I'm impressed by Keating's style, his content and performance," he said.
  "And I'm impressed by the way Hawke is thinking widely and casting his
mind forward on how to grapple with these problems affecting Australia, not
just this year or next year, not just for the next election, but with a
responsibility into the future.
  "It is an exciting period we are going through, just as it's a difficult
and worrying period.  Now we are thinking.
 "We're coming up with policies and getting co-operation with the union
movement.  It's working.
  "What is Howard going to do?  He's offering confrontation again.  He's
proposing privatisation.
  "He's proposing to sack people - we're trying to save people's jobs.
  But where is the creativity about this?"
