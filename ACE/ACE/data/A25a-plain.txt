Royal staff `moonlight'  LONDON (AAP):  

  Staff at Buckingham Palace and other royal homes regularly
"moonlight" in their spare time with the agreement of the Royal Family,
it was disclosed today.
  A palace spokesman said:  "Staff have permission to take extra jobs. 
What they do in their own time is their business."
  He was commenting on a report in today's Daily Mirror which said Prince
Charles' $462-a-week butler, Harold Brown, could be employed for private
parties for $69.22.
  The newspaper said he could be hired - preferably for cash - by ringing
Kensington Palace.
