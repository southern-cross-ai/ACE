   More and more fruit and vegetable markets are having an exotic fruit
corner. But too often not enough information is given to some of the less
common fruits, such as the carambola (star fruit), breadfruit, pepino and
even the persimmon.
  Carombola is a waxy, yellow or yellow-brown fruit. It's shaped like a
five-pointed star, hence the name star fruit or five corners. Use as soon
as possible or store briefly in refrigerator, well wrapped. First, wash,
then slice crosswise or lengthwise and remove seeds. It can be poached,
or stewed alone or with other fruits. It can also be used fresh in fruit
salads, made into jams, jellies, chutney, or juiced and added to other fruit
drinks. Carambola is high in vitamin A, and has also some vitamin C,
phosphorus, calcium, iron and potassium.
  Breadfruit, a native of Asia, spreading from Sri Lanka to China, is a
large green, rough-skinned fruit, turning a slight yellow when ripe. The
flesh when fully ripe is yellow and sweet, and tastes like fresh bread,
which probably explains its name. Cook and use the same way as potatoes,
or use for desserts. Cook then mash, or cook with milk or cream and sugar,
or serve with custard or sweet sauce. Seeds can also be cooked and eaten
like chestnuts.
  Pepino, originally from Peru, is also called tree melon or mellowfruit.
Shaped like a small melon, it has a satin-like green skin with vivid purple
stripes that change from green to yellow when ripe. The flavour is very
delicate, a mixture of melon, pineapple and lemon. You can use as any of
the melons, and the seed section is sweet and edible.
  Persimmon has a rich, delicious flavour, and must be eaten ripe. It's
delicious for breakfast, just cut in half and spoon out the flesh. Or use
in fruit salads, or pureed over ice-cream or sorbet, pie or steamed pudding.

  Have you stopped to consider what essentials are needed to start cooking?
The list can be endless. There are four main functions carried out in every

acquired as necessary or as culinary skills become greater.
