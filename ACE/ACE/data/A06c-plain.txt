Casino pledge by Unsworth  

  ORGANISED crime will not be allowed to infiltrate Sydney's legal casino, 
the incoming Premier, Mr Unsworth, pledged yesterday. 
  Mr Unsworth said it was imperative the Government take steps to
ensure there was no scope for criminal elements to intrude into its operations.
  He said his Government would take every step needed. 
  Only a few years ago, Mr Unsworth was quoted as saying he didn't like 
casinos because they were a cover up for organised crime. 
  He said at the time he thought casinos would provide a
method of tax avoidance and lead to the corruption of casino officials and
operators. 
  But Mr Unsworth said yesterday circumstances had changed since he
made those statements. 
  He said he now believed a legal casino at Darling Harbour would help 
eliminate the illegal activity that sprang up during the term of the 
Askin Government.
