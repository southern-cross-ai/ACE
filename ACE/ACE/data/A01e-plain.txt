A fortune has been spent but still more micros are needed  

  THE money Australian schools have invested in computers is enough to buy a 
skyscraper, perhaps even a modest tropical island.
  A nationwide study conducted for the Federal Government last year, has 
estimated that at least $57 million has been spent on more than 350,000 
microcomputers by Australian primary and secondary schools.
  But respondents to a survey for the study said the shortage of computers in 
schools and insufficient funds for purchasing more computers were still 
significant drawbacks.
  The survey found that four brands constituted 78 per cent of all machines 
used in the classrooms, with Apple representing 34 per cent, Commodore 19 per 
cent, BBC 12 per cent and Microbee 13 per cent.
  One thousand schools were surveyed for the study called Computer 
Applications in Australian Schools.  It also involved visits to four schools 
in every State by the research team.
  The study led to the discovery of an average of three computers per primary 
school and 14 computers per secondary school, with twice as many machines in 
city schools than country schools.
  A research team member, Professor John Hattie of the University of Western 
Australia, said this was one of the study's most surprising results.
  "The stereotype of a computer locked in a back room with a maths teacher is 
not borne out by the study," he said.  
  He described classroom computing in Australia as in its "early adolescence", 
moving beyond the teething stage of basic introduction towards the development
of a wide range of applications.
  Professor Hattie carried out the study with Professor Don Fitzgerald of the 
University of New England in NSW, and Professor Phil Hughes of the University 
of Tasmania.
  The study found that computers were primarily used for word processing, 
drill and practice, computer awareness courses, simulation and games.
