	<h> NZ warned off union with Australia </h>
	


	<misc> WELLINGTON, Thursday (AAP). </misc>
	

- New Zealand should not form a political union with Australia on economic
grounds, according to a major report on Closer Economic Relations (CER)
issued tonight.
  The 159-page document by the Wellington-based Institute of Policy Economic
Studies also warns against the setting up of a common Australasian currency
or the pegging of the NZ dollar to the Australian, and sees no urgency in
standardising customs controls.
  The partly government-funded report was written as a discussion paper
for several conferences on CER.
