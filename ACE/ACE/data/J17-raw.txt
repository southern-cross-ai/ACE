Arising from the literature review of research into the effects of unemployment
are several inferences that were investigated further in this section of
the study.  The hypotheses that were formulated were:

1.    Unemployed persons will have a greater number of acute illnesses than
      employed persons.

2.    Unemployed persons will have more chronic illness than employed persons.

3.    Any increase in illness rates amongst the unemployed can be accounted
      for in part by poorer health-related behaviour on the part of unemployed
      persons, (i.e. the stress of unemployment causes the unemployed person
      to smoke more, drink more etc.).

Hypotheses were investigated by the use of a series of questions within the
main questionnaire.  Responses from employed and unemployed were analysed
in the first instance using Chi-square the the Student t-test and McNemar's
&quot;Test of Proportions,&quot; as appropriate.  Multivariate analyses were carried
out on a number of dependent variables.  The same independent variables
were used throughout - employment status, place of birth, age,
occupation/previous occupation, length of unemployment, family size and
the respondent's perception regarding whether or not he found it impossible
to achieve his aims for his family (referred to as `family importance').

Respondents were also grouped according to place of birth (Australia,
England/Wales/Scotland/Ireland - referred to as U.K., and the Rest-of-the-World
- referred to as R.O.W.), and responses from employed and unemployed within
each group analysed by using Chi-square or Student t-test as appropriate.

      Hypotheses 1: `Unemployed persons will have a greater number of acute
                    illnesses than employed persons'.

This was investigated using a symptom check list to detect recent illness.
Respondents were asked if they had experienced any of the 25 symptoms listed
on page A.4 of Appendix 1 in the two weeks prior to interview.  The respondent
was required to answer either YES or NO for each symptom listed.  Results
appear in Table B1 (page A.4 of Appendix 1).

The employed and unemployed were compared using `total number of complaints
listed', as the dependent variable. Unemployed respondents listed a
significantly higher total number of complaints than employed (F(1,269)
= 10.56, p = 0.001).

In addition, frequency of reporting of each symptom was analyzed for
significant differences between employed and unemployed respondents, using
Chi-square.  Individual symptoms where frequency of reporting showed a
significant difference between employed and unemployed respondents, appear
in Table 9.1.


	<note> Table </note>
	

Each of the symptoms in which a significant difference occurred, were reported
more frequently by the unemployed.  There were no symptoms that were reported
significantly more frequently by the employed.

All symptoms in Table 9.1 are significant at the p&lt;= 0.05 level.  `Feeling
depressed', `severe headache', `dizziness', and `seriously overweight',
are significant at the p&lt;= 0.005 level.

Multivariate analysis was carried out, using `total number of complaints
listed' as the dependent variable, and examining the main effects, two-way
and three-way interactions between a number of independent variables (refer
page 66).

As previously mentioned, there is a main effect of employment status, with
unemployed listing a higher total number of complaints than employed.  There
is no main effect for place of birth upon total number of complaints listed
(i.e. `place of birth' irrespective of employment status).

However, a further analysis was carried out, examining a number of dependent
variables against whether the respondent was born in Australia, U.K. or
R.O.W.

Amongst Australian-born respondents, there is a significant difference between
the unemployed and employed, with unemployed respondents listing a higher
total number of complaints (t = 2.22, df = 114.86, p = 0.029).  There is
no significant difference between employed and unemployed respondents born
in U.K. or born in R.O.W.

There was no effect upon the dependent variable by age, occupation /previous
occupation, length of unemployment or family size.

There was a main effect of `family importance'.  That is, those respondents
who felt they were unable to achieve their family aims, list significantly
more complaints. F(1,201) = 7.88, p = 0.005).  This was irrespective of
employment status.

There was a significant three-way interaction between employment status,
place of birth and size of family (F(2,262) = 3.53, p = 0.03).  Amongst
respondents with 3 or less family members, those who are unemployed and
born in U.K., listed the highest number of complaints, and those who were
employed and born in the R.O.W., listed the least complaints.  With a family
size of three or less, there is demarcation between the employed and
unemployed, with all unemployed (regardless of place of birth) recording
more complaints than employed.

In families with 4 or more members, employed respondents who were born in
U.K. report the highest number of complaints, whereas unemployed respondents
with the same place of birth, report the least.

The clear dichotomy that occurs with family size &lt;=3 (i.e., all unemployed
list more complaints) does not occur with family sizes &gt;=4.  With a family
size &gt;=4, the unemployed record fewer complaints for respondents born in
U.K. and R.O.W..  For Australian-born respondents, the reverse is true,
with unemployed respondents listing more complaints than employed.

      Hypothesis 2: `Unemployed persons will have more chronic illness than
                    employed persons'.

This was investigated by asking respondents to indicate from a comprehensive
list of commmon chronic conditions, which illnesses (if any) they suffered
from.  The criteria for a condition to be considered `chronic' were:

2The illness had been diagnosed by a doctor.
2The illness had been present more than six months.

High numbers of both employed and unemployed respondents reported chronic
illness fulfilling the above criteria - 69.6% of employed and 71.6% of
unemployed.

The number of chronic illnesses reported appears in Table 9.2.


	<note> Table </note>
	

The majority of respondents who report having long-term illnesses report
either one or two chronic illnesses - 43.9% of employed and 37.6% of
unemployed.  A significantly higher percentage of unemployed report three
chronic illnesses - 17.2% compared with 6.0% of employed. (z = 2.76, p =
0.003). Percentages of respondents reporting four and five or more chronic
illnesses are similar amongst the employed and unemployed. Significantly more
employed report more than five chronic illnesses (z = 2.36, p = 0.009).

The type of chronic illnesses and the frequency of reporting for employed
and unemployed respondents, appear on pages A.5 and A.6 of Appendix 1. 
Responses are summarized up to a maximum of five chronic conditions illnesses.

Despite significant differences in reporting of `three' and `more than five'
chronic illnesses, there is no significant difference in the total number of
chronic illnesses reported by the employed and unemployed. The unemployed
reported the following chronic conditions more frequently than the employed.

The only one of these differences which reaches significance is for `allergy'
(z = 2.21, p = 0.0136).  It is noteworthy that, though the data is not
appropriate for reporting significant variation, whereas 5% (5/93) of the
employed reported heart and coronary disease, 13% (9/67) of the employed
reported coronary problems.

The employed reported kidney stones and bronchitis more frequently, but
once again the differences are not significant.

Multivariate analysis was carried out using the total number of chronic
illnesses listed as the dependent variable.  Results were analysed for main
effects by the independent variables, two-way and three-way interactions.

Employment status, place of birth, occupation/previous occupation, length
of unemployment, family size and family importance had no effect upon the
total number of chronic illnesses listed.  However, when subjected to an
examination of correlation (Pearson Product-Moment Correlation Co-efficient),
length of unemployment was significantly correlated with number of chronic
illnesses (n = 105; r = 0.22; p&lt;0.05).  Furthermore, Chi-Square analysis
of numer of chronic illnesses against months of unemployment indicates a
significant increase in the number of illnesses reported in those unemployed
for more than 12 months.

The important implication for further investigation is that illnesses multiply
in the population who endure a series social dislocation (e.g. unemployment)
for longer than a year.

There was a significant main effect for age (F(3,201) = 6.0, p = 0.001).
Age was divided into 4 categories &lt;=35, 36 - 45; 46 - 55; &gt;=56.  Those aged
46 - 55 years of age listed the highest total number of chronic illnesses,
followed by &gt;=56 years of age.  Those aged less than or equal to 35 years
of age, reported the least chronic illness. (This effect was independent
of employment status).

A significatnt two-way interaction was found between length of unemployment
and place of birth (F(6,92) = 2.82, p = 0.015).  Those born in U.K. who
had been unemployed more than three years listed the most chronic illnesses.

Respondents were asked to what degree they found their chronic illness to
be limiting.  Reference to Table 9.3 shows 6.4% of unemployed reported being
unable to work at all (compared with no employed) and 17.4% of unemployed
reported being able to carry out some work but not a full day's work (compared
with 6.0% of employed).  Cross-tabulation of results and application of
Chi-square shows the unemployed to report significantly more disability
as a result of their chronic illness (X2 = 23.12, df = 3, p&lt;=0.001)

There are a number of behavioural parameters that reflect an individual's
perception of their health.  These were investigated in this study in order
to further address the hypothesis that the unemployed are `less well' than
the employed.  The behavioural indices used in the Mature Unemployed Study
were: days spent in bed recently due to illness/injury; the degree to which
illness had compromised normal daily activities; recent hospital admissions;
consultations with health professionals; and medication use.

The numbers of employed and unemployed that reported spending days in bed
over the two weeks prior to interview due to accident or illness were not
significantly different (5.4% of employed and 4.6% of unemployed).  There
were no significant differences in the number of days spent ill in bed in
the two weeks prior to interview, in limitation of daily activities due
to illness or injury in the two weeks prior to interview, or in the number
of days that activities were limited.

There is no significant difference in the number of hospital admissions
in the twelve months prior to interview.  7.7% of employed respondents and
12.8% of unemployed respondents having had hospital admissions.  1.8% of
unemployed respondents (and no employed respondents), had been admitted
to a psychiatric hospital within the same period.  In both groups, the majority
of thoe*those who had experienced admission to hospital, had done so on
only one occasion.

The reason for the most recent hospital admission appears in Table B3, of
Appendix 1.  Significantly more unemployed (7.3%) were admitted for surgery
than employed (z = 1.78, p = 0.0375).  No other differences between employed
and unemployed are significant.  The employed are fairly evenly divided
between admissions for surgery (2.4%) and admissions for sickness/illness
(3.0%).

Respondents were asked to indicate the last time they had consulted a doctor.
Results are summarized in Table 9.4 below.


	<note> Table </note>
	

Significantly more unemployed than employed had visited a doctor within
the two weeks prior to interview (z = 2.06, p = 0.0197).  There was no
significant difference in respondents who had visited a doctor two weeks
to three months ago.  The difference between employed and unemployed once
again became significant in the three months to six weeks time period, with
less unemployed having consulted a doctor than employed within three to
six months of the interview ( z = 2.239, p = 0.0084).  Figures for six to
twelve months and more than twelve months showed no significant difference.

Multivariate analyses were carried out on two dependent variables:

2Last time a doctor was consulted.
2Total number of visits to the doctor in the week prior to interview.

With the first dependent variable (`last time a doctor was consulted'),
data was analysed within four time frames: 1) less than three months; 2)
four to six months; 3) seven to twelve months; 4) more than twelve months.
This analysis failed to separate the figures for `two weeks ago or less',
and the significant difference shown in Table 9.4 was not apparent.

For the second dependent variable mentioned above, (`total number of visits
to the doctor in the week prior to interview') there were no effects from
employment status, place of birth, occupation/previous occupation, length
of unemployment, family size or family importance.
