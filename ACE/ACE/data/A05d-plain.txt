Evans moves for steady oil prices  

AUSTRALIAN Energy Minister Gareth Evans has thrown his support behind stable 
world oil prices.
  Mr Evans is visiting Gulf oil nations ahead of the Organisation of Petroleum 
Exporting Countries' October 6 meeting in Geneva.
  He discussed prices with Kuwait Oil Minister Sheikh Ali al-Khalifa al-Sabah 
yesterday and, according to official sources, expressed Australia's 
willingness to maintain price stability.
  Mr Evans was due later to fly to Saudi Arabia before visiting Oman on a 
four-nation tour.
  His talks came on top of forecasts by Iranian Oil Minister Gholamreza 
Aqazadeh that OPEC will work for a $US19 a barrel oil price by year-end.
  The Iranian minister was speaking in Jeddah where he met Saudi Arabia's Oil 
Minister Ahmed Zaki Yamani.
  Together, they discussed prices and production quotas for OPEC's 13 member 
states.
  Before leaving Iran, Aqazadeh said he would possibly discuss regional 
issues with Saudi and Kuwaiti heads of state - a reference to the six-year-old 
Iran-Iraq war.
  He called the meeting with Sheikh Yamani "brotherly and friendly."
