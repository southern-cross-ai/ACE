BEING a city librarian (glasses and bike-clips, custodian of culture) promotes
dreams of the wide-open spaces, release from entrapment, an atavistic yearning
for the wilderness of nature - or at least for some kind of fulfilment in
a pleasantly bucolic setting. Fragonard would do. Justine, enchafed in
housewifery, at some neap tide of life, certainly needed a rest. When we
went on our holidays we found ourselves in a tiny flat high up in a round
tower that reared phallic-like from swarms of hot cars and the earnest traffic
of the flabby: the fey gaudiness of those desperate for glamour. Prey to
the brochures. Still, there was the sea.
  We went swimming every day, just beyond the creeping shadows of the tall
buildings. The children had to be watched carefully lest they stray with
their new rubber surf-floats beyond the orange and yellow flags, the strictly
demarcated ken of the life-saver who sat risking skin cancer, high up in
his spindly chair. Much as one feels on occasion like straying beyond the
flags that common sense and our quotidian lives impose. The spirit seeks
folly now and then, like a cat to eat grass for health. (I should put that
in my diary.)
  One afternoon, curious at the growing crowd of people at the water's edge,
we sidled closer and soon joined in the seeking out of hundreds of little
fish caught in the rock pools; cried with delight or chagrin according to
our measure of success as we hunted with clumsy predatoriness. One of the
men, scabby lips, skinny wrinkled legs under voluminous shorts, told me
they were pilchards, good for bait he intended to use in the lake. &quot;Beyond
the island, that's where the fish are, bream this long, no kidding.&quot;
  That night I told Justine and the children as we hunched over tea in the
park (hamburgers for them but yoghurt for me) that we ought to get a boat
the next day and go fishing according to the man's advice. Justine's shoulders,
which I noticed those days were becoming more humped, shrugged not so much
with assent as resignation.
  &quot;I'm going to catch five fish, I have a feeling,&quot; Amanda said.
  Touching a new pimple on his chin, Andrew scorned quietly through a truss
of teeth bracers, &quot;Only fish you're likely to catch are fish fingers.&quot; Older
than Scott by two years, Andrew was very different in looks and temperament.
Whereas Andrew was fair-complexioned, sly and passive, Scott was dark, direct
and combative. Amanda, two years younger again (Justine had planned carefully)
was a chameleon of emotion, calculating with callous pragmatism what mood
and line of attack were needed for each situation.
  The children were highly excited and got us up at the crack of dawn. On
the beach we killed time by writing our names hugely on the sand with our
toes, and watching the grim joggers in their gladiatorship with ageing,
as well as the inane merriment of seniors on their way to the baths that
nestled among the rocks below the new Kentucky Fried Chicken place. The
waves came in remorselessly, their tops a lacy foam half of the air and
tentative in their flirting, or fighting, with the dark muscle of water
underneath. Thesis and antithesis; then the rodomontade of resolution, the
climaxing shudder, and the seeking up the sands like desperate fingers;
then the retreat, so flat and inglorious, to begin all over again.
  Finally we took off for the channel with the plastic bucket, newspapered
and decomposing pilchards, fishing lines, sunburn cream, towels etc. and
hired a boat, five dollars for the first hour, three for each subsequent
hour. We climbed aboard and cautiously assumed a seat. Grabbing the oars
I put on some show of expertness, conscious of all the fisher-folk lining
the bank. It was easy going with the current and my strokes were in the
main confident, though I tended to drift to one side.
  &quot;You're drifting to the left,&quot; Scott warned.
  &quot;You mean port, left is port on a boat. And what's right?&quot;
  &quot;Unport?&quot; suggested Justine provocatively, smiling.
  &quot;No, I'm serious. Come on - starboard! Starboard!&quot;
  We left the channel and cut across shallow water with lots of weed in
which my oars became entangled.
  &quot;Have you kids heard of the Sargasso Sea?&quot;
  &quot;No.&quot;
  &quot;Would you like to hear about it?&quot;
  &quot;No.&quot;
  One always tends to impart interesting lore to one's children - take the
Greek myths, Ulysses and all that as an example. But what attempts are made
are usually perfunctory for various reasons that no doubt relate to
evasiveness. 
  &quot;Look!&quot; cried Justine. &quot;Pelicans. Aren't they lovely?&quot; They cruised down
from the air not far from our boat, in wobbly fashion, as if they might
have a crash landing (although they didn't), and quickly resumed the elegance
they had in the air. Exotic creatures, they had the shape of a squashed
Z, and looked distinctly droll and knowing.
  Amanda enunciated, &quot;A wonderful bird is the pelican,/It holds more in
its beak/Than its belly can.&quot;
  And she added, &quot;We learned that at school.&quot;
  &quot;Know that. We learned that in kindergarten,&quot; Scott's voice was contemptuous.
  &quot;There's the island,&quot; Andrew pointed, looking like a black-and-white minstrel
with his zinc-creamed lips. It was a scruffy little island, but allured
- as islands tend to do.
  &quot;Look at the boats around,&quot; added Justine. &quot;I'd say that's where the fish
are.&quot;
  A huge launch zapped past, almost swamping our boat.
  &quot;There's no doubt about it!&quot; I hissed at the vulgar tableau: men grinning,
with terry-towelling hats, sun-glasses, beer-bellies and a girl-woman sprawled
on the cabin roof, in a bikini, oiled and roasting like some sacrificial
offering.
  &quot;You've got a fair way to go, dear,&quot; chirped Justine sweetly.
  &quot;I know, I know.&quot;
  At last we broached the island, and I chose a place not far off where
weed abutted stretches of sand. The weed swayed luxuriantly like woman's
hair. Venus pausing on her way up.
  &quot;This will do,&quot; I asserted, turning uncertainty into mystery.
  &quot;Dad, can I have some bait?&quot; Andrew piped.
  &quot;Me too, dad,&quot; came Scott.
  &quot;All right,&quot; My hands were already blistered from rowing, but I managed
to saw off a pilchard's head with the serrated knife, and cut the body into
four pieces.
  &quot;Who wants the head?&quot;
  &quot;Me!&quot; said the boys.
  &quot;Here, Amanda, give me your hook for bait.&quot;
  Soon we were all sitting quietly with our lines in, our eyes whipped by
the sun off the water. I thought of Descartes fishing in the canal at Rynsburg,
unfettered, brooding on dualism. Then there was Izaak Walton, of course.
And Sue Frayn. Such straying beyond the flags of propriety, backwards through
the shifting foci of memory.
  Yes, it was the pelicans that did it. During the last year in primary
school, for &quot;Poetry&quot; we had to copy a poem into our exercise books and then
go outside to learn the thing off by heart. That was &quot;Poetry&quot;. The poem
for the Friday (&quot;Poetry&quot; was done, as though an afterthought, on Friday
afternoon) was &quot;Where the Pelican Builds its Nest&quot; by Mary Hannay Foot.
  Most of the boys beelined for the peppercorns to have a quick smoke, but
I, a would-be runner, found myself in the corrugated-iron lunch shed sitting
opposite Sue Frayn and Debbie Robinson. The girls recited with noisy vigour,
giving the lines a sensuous lilt that made me feel miserable. I was more
interested in poking with a stick some papery egg-sacs of redback spiders
in a groove of the wall. But suddenly I realized Sue was sitting with book
on lap, legs open, not much, not enough for Debbie to notice but enough
for me to glimpse her pants. It occurred to me she was doing it deliberately
for me, since she cast quick, collusive glances at me, smiling. Thinking
it very generous of her, I wished I could reciprocate in some manner that
was not too reckless.
  I was going to ask her to come to the matinee on Saturday. &quot;Twelve O'Clock
High&quot;, but shyness or lethargy prevented. However, luck threw us together
one summery night after the slides on Tongan missionaries in the Sunday
School Hall. Some of us boys were chasing girls through the pine-trees in
the park near the oval. At one stage I caught Sue who was backed up by
accident or design against a tree. Hot and impetuous from running I kissed
her on the lips, more like a peck really, as sensual as a clerk stamping
a parcel. I marvelled at such abandon, nostrils dilated at her cheap scent
blending with my Californian Poppy. Then she ducked away, giggling to the
other girls, saving me.
  In the playground the next day the boys asked each other, &quot;What number
did you get up to?&quot; Number one was holding hands and number six the ultimate
debauch of intercourse (talked of boldly but hazily understood). My admission
of three drew competitive glances and affirmation of sodality, notwithstanding
my aversion to smoking.
  Sue's father, a bank accountant, was soon shifted to another town, and
my interests turned increasingly to running and wattle-barking (this meant
stripping bark of young wattle trees and sending it to Adelaide to be used
in some tanning process - the pocket-money was quite attractive).
  But I did see her from time to time at High School sports carnivals and
a footy grand final where she and her mother tended a copper for hot-dogs.
She stood smiling, cheeks red from the raw winter's day, eyes lustrous like
ripe olives, blck hair responding subtly to a caress of wind, her cable-knitted
jumper undulant with suggestion. That I ought to have helped fate along
could not have struck me as imperative enough, so I left the matter in
abeyance, for ever, for ever regretting the loss. In her became crystallized
all significance attaching to lost opportunity. Over which there is always
such repining, fighting the present with the past.
  Much of our life is backward-looking, wistful for that will-o'-the-wisp
completeness we aspire to. We would knit our lives whole with those stubborn
strands of romanticism, which nevertheless corrupt.
  Often I've wallowed in speculation: where is she now? Perhaps family-ridden,
soldiering on through the mire of generation; could have cancer, could be
dead, dwindling limbs composed among the wet grains of earth. But that regimen
of nibbling at the past, far from curbing our self-pity of the present,
nourishes it, lets it flower froth in cankerous infestation.
  I revert to Ulysses with glass (Telemachus more likely) who noted with
bland distaste that Justine had turned her back the better to hold her line
- an unignorable back, inimical even. The pelicans decided to leave, hauling
their limbs into the heavy air. I don't know where they nest, but I'm sure
it's not as far as Foot suggests. At school her poem suggested to me
adventuring far to somewhere near the South Australian and Queensland border.
  Yeats chose swans. For my part I would choose pelicans, they're such
congenial creatures, rather mild and vulnerable like us moderns. Not like
the aristocratic swans with their serpent necks and beaks that might attack,
raping a patient Leda. (The word &quot;patience&quot;, I'd noted in my diary, is similar
in meaning to &quot;suffering&quot; and &quot;passion&quot;. Interesting.)
  &quot;Caught one, dad,&quot; Scott announced.
  &quot;Squire. Too small - toss him back.&quot;
  &quot;But dad, it's my first fish. Can't I put him in the bucket to look at
for a bit?&quot;
  &quot;Oh, all right.&quot;
  &quot;Can you get it off the hook, dad?&quot;
  &quot;Here, give it to me then.&quot;
  &quot;Put your foot on it, dear, it's jumping all over the place.&quot; You could
tell Justine was becoming fed up.
  &quot;I know, I know,&quot; I muttered, pushing my thonged foot on the gasping fish.
  &quot;It's mouth is bleeding,&quot; Amanda accused, throwing one of Justine's lipsticky
Kleenexes at me.
  I wriggled and wrestled the hook backwards through flesh and 
cartilage*cartilege. More blood. The stare of its unblinking eye condemned 
me as I placed it in the bucket where it bucked in sudden vigour, only to 
become passive again.
