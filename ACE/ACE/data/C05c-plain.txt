The agony and the ecstasy BLUES JOHN HAMMOND
The Basement, August 19  

  DAVID Byrne once observed that people in states of religious or sexual
ecstasy usually looked utterly ridiculous. Blues singer/guitarist John
Hammond didn't look ridiculous at The Basement, but he was clearly experiencing
a form of ecstasy.
  The blues is usually about sex, something this American dynamo isn't in
a hurry to let us forget. Hammond drips sensuality, so that when he sings,
"She's a fine little pony, lord, likes to have her fun", you sure as hell
don't think of a horse.
  Keeping his left foot stomping out a libidinous beat on the floor, he
sends his fingers flying recklessly across the strings of his acoustic guitar
while his lips, when they're not giving voice to a crafty double entendre,
breathe fire and brimstone into a harmonica. Hammond doesn't so much perform
songs as pour himself into them like liquor running into a glass. The price?
A few broken strings and an audience exhausted by the sheer density of the
performance.  
  His repertoire is wide, drawing from established country and urban blues
sources (for example Robert Johnson's Crossroads, Elmore James' It Hurts
Me Too), though none of this gives off a sense that he's merely trying to
prove his authenticity or pay homage to a tradition. Hammond's cleverness
lies in adapting the acoustic style of rural blues while interpreting the
music with the jagged intensity of a city dweller.
  Since John Lee Hooker is arguably his nearest progenitor, it was appropriate
that he should sing the Detroit legend's I'm in the Mood. What was he in
the mood for?
  You really shouldn't have to ask.
