 - In the fifth such attack in less than a month, anti-apartheid
activists have wrecked a cricket club pitch in protest at the rebel Australian
cricket tour which has just begun.
  In the latest attack, a group calling itself the &quot;Night Prowlers&quot; dug
up and poured oil on a pitch in the elite white suburb of Constantia, home
of the Western Province B team.
  An attempt was also made to burn down the clubhouse but this was thwarted
by a nightwatchman.
  Previously the Western Province A ground at Newlands was attacked, the
homes of two cricketing officials damaged and the hotel in which the rebel
team was staying had stones thrown through some of its windows.
