	<h> SEMINAR - 8-9 MARCH, 1986 </h>
	

  This weekend seminar, organised by the Association for Good Government,
will be held to discuss some of the many problems of our times and the
possibility that both their arising and their solution could be integrally
bound-up with one central adjustment: that of humanity to land.
  It is essential to become aware that alternatives to our present system
of taxation exists and that money and taxation influence all social matters.
That none of our present socio-economic-political systems has brought a
solution to these problems is without question. Also, that new ideas, new
and peaceful approaches to these problems are urgently needed, can hardly
be disputed. Therefore, it is fitting to bring such ideas to the fore in
the International Year of Peace, 1986.
  The proposition for analysis is that taxation should be based on structures
relating to land on which all life depends, and other taxes should be gradually
phased out - partially or totally - as may apply. Land is the only commodity
which humans cannot produce. We cannot make more land to meet more demand.
This proposition is not a new brain wave, a clever scheme. It has been
advocated for generations. The origin can be found in the Old Testament.
Personalities like G.B.Shaw, Helen Keller, Leo Tolstoy, Woodrow Wilson,
Albert Einstein, Sun Yat Sen and many others, including Winston Churchill,
all have underwritten the morality and practicality of the idea that land
values which are created by the community should be the source of public
revenue for the government, and not taxes on labour, thrift and industry,
as we have it today.
  Site value rating is in use by some two-thirds of Australian municipalities
and was first intoduced by Henry Parkes, a friend of Henry George, the modern
protagonist of this principle. That no political party of whichever persuasion
and of whichever geographical location has ever had the courage to follow
up this proposition to its full extent demonstrates only the lack of
understanding, the lack of morality of our society but nothing more.
  Re-thinking a new economic system, one which harmonises with human needs
of body, mind and soul is the issue. Once right thoughts are established,
right action will follow. At this seminar we do not want to concentrate
on the technicalities of such a scheme. We want to make the effort to realise
that changes are necessary. We can not go on from boom to inflation, from
peace to war for ever. This cycle must be broken if our and future generations
are to live.
