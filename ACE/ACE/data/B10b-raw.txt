	<h> Fred just has to stay, his loyal fans say </h>
	

I FIND it unspeakably horrendous that you suggest putting down dear old
Fred Bassett. His loyalty to and comments on his humans beat all other 
strips for intelligence. Why not euthanasia for Norm, or Robotman?

Leave Fred Bassett alone. Read something else. There is plenty to read in The
Sun.
