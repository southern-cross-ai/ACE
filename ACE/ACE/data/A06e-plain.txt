Hospitals bailed out for last time By Peter Grimshaw  

THE State Government has had to find an extra $23 million to pull the top NSW 
public hospitals out of debt. 
  But the Health Minister, Mr Unsworth, warned yesterday that this was the 
last time the Government would rescue hospitals which overspent their budgets.
  He said hospital bosses would in future be required to stick within their
budgets or face the sack. 
  The State Opposition warned last week that many hospitals had run out of 
funds. 
  It predicted that patients would have to take their cut lunches with 
them to surgery unless the hospitals were given extra money. 
  Mr Unsworth disclosed that the major hospitals had built up debts of $8
million last financial year and a further $15 million this year. 
  He said some would be ordered to pay some of the debts themselves from 
funds they had "squirrelled away". 
  The Government would pay the rest of the bills immediately
but this was the last time hospitals could expect extra payouts, he said. 
  "One of the conditions of us allocating the extra funds is that hospitals 
give us an assurance that they will take any necessary steps to keep their 
spending patterns in line with their budgets in the future,"  he said. 
  "Already in the past two months hospitals have been able to make savings in 
some areas. 
  "But some other hospitals have continued on their merry way with little or no
regard for the financial burden already borne by the Government and taxpayers.
  "This means funds which could have been spread more evenly throughout the
health system are needed to prop up those hospitals which have not exercised
proper expenditure control measures." 
  The hospitals most in trouble were understood to be Royal Prince Alfred 
($9 million), St Vincents ($6 million) and Royal North Shore ($3.3 million). 
  Mr Unsworth agreed that some hospital authorities probably believed that 
if they got into financial trouble, the Government would always bail them 
out. 
  "But that won't be the case in future," he said. 
  "If hospitals don't accept their responsibilities and live within
their budgets, they will do so at their own peril." 
  Mr Unsworth said other areas of the State Budget would suffer as the 
Government found $23 million to pay the debts.
