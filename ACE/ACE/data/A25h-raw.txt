  A pilot on a flight from Sydney to Brisbane may have fallen asleep
behind the controls, aviation authorities believe.
  The Bureau of Air Safety Investigation has begun an inquiry into the mid-air
incident.
  The pilot was commanding a freight operations flight to Brisbane on
Monday morning but shortly before touching down failed to report his position
to airport control.
  &quot;We don't really know what happened up there,&quot; a spokesman, Mr John Death,
said today.
  &quot;We are fully aware of the incident and have begun a thorough investigation.
  &quot;For some reason the pilot failed to report his position but there was
no actual danger involved.&quot;
  The pilot, who landed the plane without incident, has been grounded while
the investigation is carried out.
  Airline authorities believe he may have experienced a technical breakdown,
but have not ruled out the possibility he could have fallen asleep at the
controls.
