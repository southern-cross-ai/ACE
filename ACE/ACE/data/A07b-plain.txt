Peko asks for talks on Kakadu  

  PEKO-Wallsend chief Charles Copeman has called on Prime Minister Bob
Hawke to stall further development in the mineral-rich Kakadu National Park
until they can discuss issues involved in mining.
  In a letter to Mr Hawke, Mr Copeman has outlined five specific areas
he wishes to argue at the planned meeting.
  Mr Hawke has yet to receive the letter, sent on Tuesday, but a spokesman
said the Government had no objection in principle to further discussions
with Peko over the issue.
  The issues to be raised were detailed yesterday by Mr Geoffrey Sherrington,
the special projects manager for Geopeko, the subsidiary company operating
in Kakadu.
  The first was a clarification of the true position of traditional
Aboriginal claims of the land regarding mining operations.
  Production came to a halt at Robe River's Pannawonica mine during a visit
by Mr Copeman yesterday.
