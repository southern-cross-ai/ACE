	<h> Pressure is on for Do Re Mi  </h>
	

LOCAL band Do Re Mi, who last year had a big hit with the sparse-sounding
Man Overboard, is back with a another single and a slightly new style. 
Guns And Butter marks a change in Do Re Mi's style. The song has a fuller,
bigger production sound than anything they have done before.
  But, according to bassist Helen Carter, Guns And Butter is &quot;more the
exception rather than the rule&quot; of material written for the band's second
album, due to be released in March.
  She said the band, led by singer Deborah Conway, was under a certain amount
of pressure to come up with a charting album following the success of
their debut LP Domestic Harmony.
  &quot;There is pressure to do better, but I think that should be put to the
side,&quot; she said.
  She said material on the new album would be more cohesive because the
band had less time to write.
  Do Re Mi, who has just finished supporting Simple Minds, is about to do
some Sydney gigs.
  Dates are: Sweethearts, November 5; Newcastle Worker's Club, November
6; Sydney Cove Tavern, November 7 and 8; and at Avalon RSL on November
9.
