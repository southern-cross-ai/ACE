It's good, clean family violence The Karate Kid returns  

  Biff! Bam! Whack! Is it Rambo? Is it Chuck Norris? No. It's the Karate
Kid himself, Ralph Macchio, kicking his way into another round of sanitised
violence.
  Will homespun Ralph prevail over the forces of evil? Will his Master 
resolve the unresolved conflict which has kept in him exile for 40 years? Will
the box office run hot.
  For answers to these and other questions, roll up to Hoyts - where Karate
Kid II, the sequel to that first martial arts blockbuster is kicking across
the screen.
  Tough but not vicious, emotional but not soppy, powerful but not obscene
- Karate Kid II occupies middle ground between the stupidity of Rambo and
the slop of Spielberg.

 Appeal  

  Heck, you could take your grandmother to see it. Or your teenage son.
As they say in the trade, here's a flick with wide appeal.
  Indeed, the conflict situation has been ingeniously set up - built around
the old and new generations in Japan, the narrowing cultural differences
between the United States and Japan and the notion of compassion versus
honor.
  The Kid's teacher Miyagi (Noriyuki Morita) receives a letter calling him
to the deathbed of his father in Okinawa.
  In going there, he must also deal with his teenage rival-in-love, now
a wealthy businessman, who has never forgiven him for stealing the heart
of the village siren.
