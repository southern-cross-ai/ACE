LEST WE FORGET... 

  THE Chernobyl disaster briefly diverted our attention from what is the
greatest threat to world safety at this time - terrorism.
  Yet it is an ever-present threat as the incident at the opening of the
Tokyo Summit has proved.
  Despite massive security precautions preceding the summit, leftist radicals
were able to fire five rockets at the State guest house where Japanese Prime
Minister Mr Nakasone was welcoming guests, including U.S. President Ronald
Reagan, yesterday.
  One of the key issues at the week-long summit will, appropriately, be
combatting terrorism.
  We wish them well ...
