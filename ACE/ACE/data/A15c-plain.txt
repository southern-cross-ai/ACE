Queensland's FBT bid opens in High Court From ROSS McSWAIN CANBERRA  

- The Queensland Government's constitutional challenge 
to the fringe benefits tax started in the High Court today.
  The challenge is based on Section 114 of the Constitution 
which stops the Commonwealth taxing any property belonging to a 
state and any state taxing property belonging to the 
Commonwealth.
  The Queensland challenge is the first against the FBT.
  But a second challenge has been lodged by the NSW Chamber of 
Commerce.
  The Chamber of Commerce challenge, also to be heard in the 
High Court, is the first by a business group.
  Their opposition will be based on a separate section of the 
Constitution which deals with taxation laws and how they 
relate to certain taxes.
  The Queensland Cabinet decided to go ahead with the 
constitutional challenge after it received a full briefing on 
July 28.
  The Federal Government has since made changes to the tax to 
eliminate "unintended consequences".
  The changes are expected to cost the Government a least $75 
million in lost revenue.
