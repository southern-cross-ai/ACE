Central role in nation's finances  

ESTABLISHED in January 1960, the Reserve Bank is Central Station to the
nation's financial traffic.
  It has a staff of more than 3,600 in all States and Territories as well
as key representatives in London and New York.
  It is banker to governments, banks and certain other financial institutions;
it prints and manages the nation's bank notes; and it provides some short-term
seasonal finance for the rural sector.
  Its major purpose is to formulate and implement monetary policy, which
has been described as the fine-tuning knob on the TV set.  Fiscal policy,
determined by government, is the bigger one that changes channels.
  As agent for the Federal Government, the Reserve Bank distributes coin,
conducts stock registries for Commonwealth securities and manages the
Commonwealth's domestic borrowing programs.
  From its headquarters in Sydney's Martin Place, it also oversees Australia's
foreign exchange market and holds and manages Australia's official reserves
of gold and foreign exchange.
  At the end of the 1985-86 financial year, the bank's total assets of $16.9
billion included almost $2 billion of gold, $8.6 billion of foreign exchange
and $4.7 billion of treasury notes and other securities.
  The governor and chairman of the board, Mr R.A. Johnston, and deputy
governor, Mr D.N. Sanders, hold seven-year appointments.  The secretary to
the Treasury, Mr Bernie Fraser, ranks third.
  Five of the other board members, TNT's Sir Peter Abeles, Sir Samuel Burston,
Mr J.N. Davenport, Mr R.G. Gregory and Sir Gordon Jackson, are all prominent
business leaders.  The former ACTU Vice-President Mr Charlie Fitzgibbon
represents the union movement.
