Artists paint for peace  

THIRTY of WA's top artists are meeting this Saturday to arrange their planned
exhibition for the 1986 Spring Peace Festival.
  The artists have previously attended a workshop on peace and are working
on paintings to be displayed in the old courthouse building in the cultural
precinct, which now becomes part of the Art Gallery of WA.
  The art exhibition, which opens on September 1, will take up the top floor
of the old courthouse while a special travelling exhibition by three women
artists from the Eastern States will occupy the ground floor with "Peace
and Nuclear War in the Australian Landscape."
  Running concurrently in the Alexander Library will be the "Young People's
Peace Show." Last year this attracted more than 1000 entries, from a giant
quilt from a kindergarten to wallhangings from Aboriginal students.
  The Spring Peace Festival has received an $18,000 grant from the Australia
Council and this will be used to cover administrative costs of what has
become one of Perth's longest running arts festivals.
  The festival also provides for groups such as "Scientists Against Nuclear
Arms" which will hold a seminar on peace with international speakers in
October, and the State film theatrette in the Alexander Library which will
host a week-long festival of peace films.
  The Spring Peace Festival will be opened on September 1 in Trinity Church
by the Minister for the Arts, Mr David Parker. -
