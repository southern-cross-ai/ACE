36 survive coach plunge off highway  

THIRTY-five people, including children and an expectant mother, were injured
today when a western Sydney-based coach crashed off the Pacific Highway.
  Many were thrown from their seats, hit the roof and fell to the aisle of
the Brisbane-bound coach.
  Five of the injured were seriously hurt.
  The crash occurred about 1.45 am, four kilometres from Kew, north of Taree,
on the Mid-North Coast and involved a coach operated by Advance Express
Coachlines, of Penrith.
  The bus was on a regular overnight service from Sydney to Brisbane via
the Gold Coast.
  Thirty-six people, including two drivers, were aboard.
  The bus left the highway on a slight bend, went to the incorrect side
of the highway and ploughed about 80 metres through bush before hitting
a large sign and several trees.
  "It also bounced over a two-metre deep drain which jolted most of the
passengers from their seats," Constable Rod Scarr, of Port Macquarie police,
said later.
  "The bus stayed on its wheels but the front and the undersection were
damaged.
  "People were thrown against the roof and came down into the aisle or on
seats in front of them.
  "The co-driver suffered head injuries and an expectant mum was hurt, too."
  A passing motorist saw the bus standing between the highway and just
two metres from the main northern rail line and raised the alarm.
  Six ambulances from four towns and police from Kew and Port Macquarie
went to the scene.
  They found several passengers still in the coach unable to move because
of injuries.
  In a three-hour operation ambulance officers treated the injured and took
28 to hospitals in Port Macquarie and seven to Taree.
  Additional doctors, n urses and paramedic staff were called in to Hastings
District Hospital, Port Macquarie at 3.30 am to help.
  Three of the injured passengers, two men aged 32 and 42 and a woman, 55,
were admitted in a serious condition.
  Acting executive officer at the hospital, Mr Kim Everson, said the expectant
mother and her unborn baby were all right.
