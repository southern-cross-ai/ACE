  A year ago on this date, South Australians were up and running to the polls.
  The result is history - John Bannon went from being the leader of a minority
Government to a record Labor victory, and the Liberal Party suffered a crushing
metropolitan defeat.
  And despite the brave face John Olsen was showing to his troops on Friday

  He told a Liberal women's council gathering, &quot;You will have noticed the
cockiness of the Bannon Government, so apparent earlier this year, has largely
dissipated in past months.
