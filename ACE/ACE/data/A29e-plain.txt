I'll fight Govt, vows resident  

AN ENVIRONMENTAL report on the Casuarina reserve destined to become a prison
should be released, says a man who lives 50 metres from the reserve.
  Mr Jim Elliot has called on the State Government to release a report
prepared by the Environmental  Protection Authority for the former Minister
for Environment, Mr Ron Davies, last August.
  "Local residents have a right to know all the details," Mr Elliot said.
  The decision to build the prison on the conservation reserve went ahead
though the EPA advised against it.  The site was studied by the EPA under
its System-Six report.
  EPA chairman Barry Carbon said that the former Minister was advised last
year that it would be inappropriate to develop the Casuarina site.
  But the Government says it will go ahead with the project.
  It will set aside $100,000 to buy other land as compensation, and has
designated that the department of Conservation and Land Management manage
the buffer zone around the 30-hectare prison.
  The plans have made Mr Elliot (33) of Orton Road, "hopping mad" and he
says he will fight to stop the Government "desecrating" the site.
  He has written a five-page letter to the Kwinana Town Council asking for
a public referendum on the issue and he is also organising a petition.
  Mr Elliot wants the Minister for Prisons, Mr Berinson, to outline why
Casuarina was chosen as the site.
  Mr Ian Fraser, president of the Kwinana Rural Ratepayers and the Residents'
Association, said the disbelief he felt when the prison was announced had
since turned to anger.
