Nugget hits the world LONDON:  

 Australia has launched its new gold bullion coin, the Australian
Nugget, on the world market in the first sanctions salvo against South Africa's
Kruggerand.
  However, in carving up the lucrative bullion market at a time of peak
gold prices, the Australian Nugget will compete against Canada's Maple
Leaf, already on issue, and the soon-to-be-released American Eagle. 
  The WA Premier, Mr Burke, is in London to arrange dealer-distributors
for the coin, from the Royal Perth Mint, which is struck in denominations
from $100 to $530.   
  However, world market demand will set the nuggets' prices.
