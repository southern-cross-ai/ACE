Hospitals `allow patients to die' MELBOURNE:  

  Some doctors in Melbourne hospitals are allowing terminally
ill patients to die by withdrawing treatment from them in certain
circumstances, says one medical director.
  The practice was going on even though it was illegal, said Dr Syd Allen,
medical director of the Queen Victoria Hospital.
  Dr Allen said changes to the law were necessary to protect medical staff
before the situation was tested in court.
 Doctors feared a court case could result in "an assault" on the medical
system, he said. 
  Dr Allen said he was confident that the courts would support such a practice
in certain circumstances, but acknowledged that doctors could be charged
with manslaughter if life-preserving treatment was withdrawn from a terminally
ill patient.                                     
  Dr Allen was speaking after addressing a public hearing organised by a
government committee inquiring into "options for dying with dignity".
