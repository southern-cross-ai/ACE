John Martin by Royston Harpur  

The injection of `content' into the works of
John Martin, a committed modernist, has produced
a powerful body of work concerned with politics
and metaphysics, but retaining great
internal integrity.

   I FEEL PAIN for young artists today. The territory of modernism
has largely been conquered, there is no longer much unmapped
territory, the ground has pretty much been covered. As modern
painting completes its task, younger artists are reduced, by
arriving so late historically, to adding paragraphs or footnotes of
great refinement, rather than whole chapters to the body of
modernist art.'
   `While it is sometimes said in defence of figuration that
abstraction demands of the viewer too much predisposed sympathy, in
fact abstraction has suffered throughout its history from the
nervous efforts of those abstract painters who try too hard to
rationalize or justify the sympathy one would naturally grant them
with the result that direct experience of the art itself is
smothered in a deluge of information.'
   John Martin is a mid-career artist firmly committed to the path
of Modernism and so must grapple with the problems expressed in the
two statements above. The result of this grappling is a powerful
body of work, particularly in recent years. An artist whose work
deserves far wider recognition, he is only now becoming more widely
known since he began exhibiting on a regular basis at the Mori
Gallery in Sydney.
   As a formalist, his early work was influenced by the `Greenberg'
painters of the 1940s and 1950s, a not untypical apprenticeship for
a young painter emerging in Sydney in the late 1960s. His work was
large, open and post-painterly, with perhaps some special reference
to Clyfford Still. After an extended period of working in England
in the early 1970s he returned to Australia to live in the Hunter
Valley region of New South Wales. This allowed him the use of very large
studios; an intense period of self-examination and work commenced.
