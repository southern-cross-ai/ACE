Mature Garner knows how to win the ladies By DENNIS WATT VIDEO REVIEW  

  A mature and stable James Garner emerges as the big winner in RCA Columbia
Video's "Murphy's Romance".
  As mildly eccentric Murphy Jones, he wins the heart of newly divorced
and fiercely independent Emma Moriarty (Sally Field).
  And that's not a bad feat considering he's 60, she's 33 and her handsome but
oh-so-young and immature former husband also is on the scene.
  The film opens with Emma moving with her young son to Arizona, where
she is determined to set up her own horse business on a rundown ranch.
  
 Absorbing  

Everything seems to be against her. The ranch looks like something left
after a cyclone and the local cowboys insist she is the wrong sex for the
job.
  Battling financial difficulties and local opposition, she strikes up a
cautious friendship with Murphy.
  Although the film will not go down as a romantic epic - especially
considering viewers are treated to only one quick peck between the duo
in the full 104 minutes - it is nevertheless absorbing viewing as Emma
tries to pick Mr Right.
  The film predictably has a happy ending and viewers are left with the
distinct impression that love conquers all.
  Hopefully it also overcomes modern male's habit of dying, on the average,
at an age five to seven years younger than their wives.
  On that basis, if Murphy lives to 80, poor old Emma will still have to
soldier on for at least another 30 years all on her lonesome.
  Not to worry. No doubt with Murphy's experience of life to call on, they
will live every day to the full in the 20 (maybe) years they have left
together.

  For a revolutionary treat, lovers of zany humor would do well to get  their
hands on Warner Home Video's "Start The Revolution Without Me".
  The film, which has achieved cult status among enthusiasts, takes the
universal theme of mistaken identity and creates an hilarious madcap comedy
involving two sets of twins.
  The twins meet just before the French Revolution and go on to cause complete
havoc in a France on the brink of turmoil.
  The cast is led by Donald Sutherland and Gene Wilder, who take every
opportunity to go way over the top.
  Gene Wilder has never been funnier and his contrasting portrayal of the
two characters borders on brilliant.
  One set of twins, masquerading successfully as illiterate and inept peasants,
are mistaken for two of the greatest and most feared swordsmen in France.
