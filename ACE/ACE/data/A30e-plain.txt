...and in KL, a birthday bargain   

IF you're planning to be in Kuala Lumpur between now and September 30, a
penny-wise accommodation choice would be the new Shangri-La Hotel.
  As a first birthday promotion, the hotel is offering 40 per cent discounts
on rooms.  The discounts bring the price of a "superior" room to approximately
$60 (twin share) and a "deluxe" room to approximately $70.
  The discounts also apply to the larger suites in the hotel.
