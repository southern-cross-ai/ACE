AFGHANISTAN Colonel defects to the rebels ISLAMABAD, Thursday (Reuter).  

 - A senior Afghan army officer said yesterday
he had defected to the anti-government Moslem rebels two weeks ago, and
painted a grim picture of the deteriorating military situation inside the
country.
  Colonel Mir Hashmatullah, 43, deputy commander of a division stationed
between Kabul and the border with Pakistan, told a news conference in
Islamabad that he had become a convinced anticommunist since the Soviet
military intervention in 1979.
  Colonel Hashmatullah, who reached Pakistan with his wife and three children
a few days ago, said he had joined the radical Moslem Hezb-e-Islami group,
one of the main guerrilla organisations fighting the Soviet-backed Government
in Kabul.
  Referring to the state of the Afghan army, he told reporters the men did
not want to fight the rebels, relations with the Soviet forces in the country
were poor and the military situation was deteriorating.
  Colonel Hashmatullah's defection, 13 days ago, was followed a week later
by that of an Afghan air force pilot who flew his Soviet-built Mig-21 jet
fighter across the border to Pakistan.
  A Pakistani Foreign Ministry spokesman said yesterday that the aircraft
would be kept in Pakistan until the end of the "civil war" in Afghanistan,
following standard international practice.  Kabul had not requested its
return.  The spokesman said the pilot, identified by Afghan exiles as
Lieutenant Mohammad Daud, would be given political asylum.
