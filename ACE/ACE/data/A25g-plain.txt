Paris terror toll climbs to 10 dead PARIS (AAP):  

  The death toll in the September wave of terrorist attacks
has risen to 10, with the death of a young woman wounded in the bombing
of a discount clothing store on September 17.
  Police said the bomb-thrower had been identified from photographs as Emile
Abdallah, a brother of Georges Ibrahim Abdallah who is one of three Middle
East terrorists whose freedom has been demanded by the group claiming
responsibility for the bombings.
  Emile and three other Abdallah brothers, also sought by French authorities,
have told reporters they have not left Lebanon in recent months and had
nothing to do with the bombings.
