	<h> No sex please, we're British and celibate </h>

IT is a brave woman who takes on the world and says celibacy would do it
good.
  But in the space of a fortnight, English journalist Liz Hodgkinson, herself
a partner in a celibate marriage with husband Neville, has become Britain's
best known celibate with the appearance of her book, Sex is Not Compulsory.
  It argues celibacy can be good for physical and mental health, creativity
and relationships.
  Liz and Neville have been married 21 years, but their sex lives ended
five years ago.
  The avalanche of publicity, including coverage in all the main daily
newspapers, television and radio, seems to indicate the time is right to
propose the case for celibacy, but why?
  One reason, according to Liz, is a wide range of medical arguments which
militate against a sexual lifestyle.
  These include mounting medical evidence of the danger of chemical and
mechanical contraceptive devices, the increase in cervical cancer, the
spread of hepatitis B and AIDS.
  Also she quotes new scientific evidence that a lot of sex produces a
lot of arousal hormones floating around in the bloodstream; these affect
the immune system.
  She says there is increasing evidence sex does not necessarily make people
happy.
  &quot;The statistics disprove that sex keeps people together.
  &quot;More and more marriages are breaking up; this at a time when people are
having more frequent sex than they have ever had in the history of the world.
  &quot;There is also the inescapable fact that the incidence of child abuse,
violent sex crimes, rape, incest and pornography have gone up alarmingly
over the last 20 years.

  &quot;A positive decision for celibacy would also alleviate some of the pangs
of adolescence, when teenagers feel they must be `getting it' or else they
are failures.
  &quot;They could concentrate on school work and other development instead
of worrying about being sexually active.
  &quot;These things seem to suggest that far from making people happy, content,
loving and giving, sex seems to be having the opposite effect in our society.&quot;
  But in the end, health was not the prime reason Liz and her husband decided
to become celibate.
  &quot;I was getting nothing from it. At that time I thought there was something
wrong with me and that if I tried harder I could bring back the excitement.
  &quot;But I found it had gone and it was nothing to do with Neville; it was
that I simply didn't want it anymore, not with anybody.&quot;
  Her husband, also a journalist, came to understand her point of view
when he came in contact with a meditation group which practised celibacy.
  The Hodgkinsons*Hodgkinson's decided to give celibacy a try.
  &quot;It sounded very odd at first but we found there was only benefit. This
is what I am anxious to pass on to people,&quot; Neville said.
  &quot;I'm not saying everyone  ought to be celibate, I have no authority to
say that. But for many people it is an option they have never considered.
  &quot;Everyone should realise they have the choice. If they do not want to
exercise it that's up to them.&quot;
  In a sense, a commitment to celibacy would be a positive approach to
a change that occurs anyway.
  Marriage surveys show the frequency of sexual intercourse declines gradually
with every successive year of marriage.
  It is mildly ironic it was the proliferation of sex manuals which was one
of the main catalysts for the book.
  &quot;As a journalist myself over the last couple of years, I seem to have
had an avalanche of sex manuals landing on the doormat, and all more or
less saying the same thing, that human beings were incomplete without a sexual
partner, Liz said.
  &quot;But my feeling was that this simply was not true; that they were misleading
and perpetuating a lie.
  &quot;So I felt a lot of people were being made very unhappy by thinking there
was something wrong with them if they weren't bursting with sexual desire
all the time.&quot;
