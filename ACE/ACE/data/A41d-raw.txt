  The captivating sounds of the bouzouki have been part of the Adelaide
scene for many years, and a trip to Greece this week by a father and son
will ensure it stays that way.
  Kevin Amanatidis is an up and coming bouzouki player who is going back
to his father's birthplace to learn from the experts.
  Restaurateur and chef Basil Amanatidis will fly out of Adelaide with his
18-year-old son on Tuesday, heading for Athens.
  For Kevin, it's the chance of a lifetime.  He will enter music school
in Athens and will take specialised external bouzouki tuition.
  &quot;Kevin probably has gone as far as he can with is bouzouki playing in
Australia - certainly Adelaide, anyway&quot;, a proud dad, Basil said.
  &quot;Greece is where the experts are, so we will go to them&quot;.
  The bouzouki, a development of the lute and mandolin, is a traditional
Greek instrument which has soared in popularity in the West, largely because
of the exposure to Greek cafe music and its use in Greek film soundtracks.
  They are not made commercially in Australia.  Kevin's current bouzouki
is Athens-made and worth about $2500.
  Good instruments take months, sometimes years, to make, allowing for the
curing of the woods and the painstaking joining of dozens of pieces to form
the body.
  They usually are highly ornate, set with mother-of-pearl carvings and
other decoration.
  For Basil, it's a journey back to see a Greece he's not visited for about
30 years - and it's also partly a business trip.
  Having just sold his control of the kitchen at the Gothic Hotel, this
long-time chef will be looking at the popular Greek taverns and cafes to
&quot;maybe incorporate some ideas in Adelaide&quot;.
  Kevin will be in Greece for about a year, while his father will be returning
in about six weeks.
