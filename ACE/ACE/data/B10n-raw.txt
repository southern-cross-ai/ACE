	<h> Doubts on water audit figures </h>
	

AFTER publication of my letter concerning excess water rates I was offered
a water audit by the MMBW. It was helpful but revealed no significant wastage
and supported my contention that 150,000 litres a year is a most unrealistic
level on which to base future water taxes.
  Without garden watering or a dishwasher, our consumption rate continues
to be around 900 litres a day, some 300,000-plus a year for two adults,
making a joke of the MMBW chairman's reported contention that 190,000 litres
a year for two elderly people was &quot;inordinately high&quot;.
  B. Freeman (Nov. 18) supported my belief that the Board is selling us a
&quot;pup&quot;. No one can object to paying for water but the MMBW should admit that
its figures are based on only 11 months' consumption and are set at an unreal
level to enable more taxes to be collected.
