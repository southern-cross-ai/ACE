FAIR PLAY
The Sun SAYS 

THE Arbitration Commission may yet change itself into a force for national
economic sanity.

  The super scheme decision continued the commission's shift from industrial
peace-keeper - at any price - to economic umpire.
  And the commission promises to pay more attention to the economic
consequences of future wage decisions. National benefit has, at last, become
a measure of trade-union demands.
  This new forum effectively challenges Mr Hawke to argue a case for economic
action where previously he has publicly given only a wink, a nod or a hint
of what he wants. 
  Instead of halfbacking a review of holiday penalty rates and passing
the buck to employers, the Prime Minister can now appeal to an umpire
who will pay him more attention.
  The commission's latest decisions are a setback for unions. The strain
on the Accord will increase, with political complications for the Government.
  But having a national umpire with two good eyes on the economic play should
inspire widespread confidence.
